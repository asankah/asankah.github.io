You're looking to buy a TV. The word "Smart" is plastered all over your search
results and across the bright crips displays at your local retail store. Much
like the word "Stereo" in the 90's, it seems unwise to buy a device that doesn't
sport this buzzword.

Let me try and alleviate the anxiety you feel about choosing a "dumb" TV.

A decent 4K television has to calculate colors for 8.3 million pixels per frame
for at least 60 frames per second. That's roughly half a billion pixels to
calculate every second. Then we have audio, and a demanding decoding pipeline
for HD content. Even the bare minimum functionality requires some heavy
processing power.

It's tempting then to upsell the consumer by bundling some subscription services
of the internet connected variety. What possible harm could there be? Let's
count the ways.
