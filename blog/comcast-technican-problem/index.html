scheduled appointment window. In preparation I had scheduled a day of
working from home.</p><p>As the appointment window unceremoniously came to a close vacillated
over when it would be a reasonable time to call Comcast again to see
what’s going on. That’s when I noticed the technician’s truck pull up
beside our house. They rolled down the window and surveyed the scene for
a brief moment, looked at something inside their truck, rolled up the
window and promptly drove off.</p><p>“That’s it,” I thought. That was the right time to call Comcast.
That’s what I did. After a long wait<a href=#fn2 class=footnote-ref id=fnref2 role=doc-noteref><sup>2</sup></a> the friendly service
person on the other end of the line told me that the according to the
technician nobody answered the door. It took some convincing on my part
to establish that:</p><ol type=a><li>I was there the whole time. Nobody rang the doorbell.</li><li>The doorbell works.</li><li>The technician — assuming that the person who drove by was the
scheduled technician — did drive by, but they didn’t get out of the
vehicle to ring any doorbell.</li><li>My phone didn’t ring, nor does it indicate any missed calls.</li><li>My phone works and has a signal.</li></ol><p>They were kind enough to ask the technician to return, but noted that
the appointment window would now be unpredictable due to prior
appointments. Sure.</p><p>Much later that evening, the same technician who drove by earlier
showed up. After they were done, I thanked them for showing up and
mentioned what happened to the original appointment slot. I didn’t
mention anything about seeing the same technician before. After all I
was just happy that I was done with this and didn’t want to cause any
trouble.</p><p>He said that technicians sometimes skip slots when they are running
behind schedule.</p><section class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-section" role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn1 role=doc-endnote><p><a href=https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/19/6004131/comcast-the-worst-company-in-america><em>The

logic behind all this becomes a little clearer.</p><p>You see, had the technician had tried to honor the original
appointment — one which they were already late for — they would’ve been
even more late for the next one. This would continue down the line until
by the end of the day pretty much all of his appointments that afternoon
would’ve registered as <em>late</em>.</p><p>Had they skipped one – my appointment as the case turned out – then
they’d potentially be on time for the rest of their appointments. The
one they skipped could later be justified as one where the customer was
not at home or any other reasonable excuses. Even if they were truthful
and were penalized for missing an appointment, it’s likely that they’d
still be better off than being late for so many more appointments.
Either way, the outcome is both better for the technician, and more
importantly, for their supervisor.</p><p>In the books, the two situations look like this:</p><table><col style=width:24%><col style=width:29%><col style=width:22%><col style=width:23%><thead><tr class=header><th>Technician’s Choice</th><th>Successful appointments</th><th>Late appointments</th><th style=text-align:left>“No-show”s <a href=#fn3 class=footnote-ref id=fnref3 role=doc-noteref><sup>3</sup></a></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class=odd><td>Honor all slots</td><td><span class="math inline">g</span></td><td><span class="math inline">l</span></td><td style=text-align:left><span class="math inline">n</span></td></tr><tr class=even><td>Skip when late</td><td><span class="math inline">g + l - s</span></td><td><span class="math inline">0</span></td><td style=text-align:left><span class="math inline">n +
s</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The outcomes depending on the technician’s decision on what to do
with late appointments. {#table:outcomes}</p><p><span class="math inline">g</span> are the <em>good</em> slots where
the technician is able to show up during the appointment window. <span class="math inline">l</span> are those where the technician was not
available during the appointment window. In either case some number of
households are not going to be home or not ready for service. Those are
<span class="math inline">n</span>.</p><p>When the technician decides to skip late appointments some number –
<span class="math inline">s</span> in the table above – will turn into
additional no-shows. However, skipping these will mean that the
technician can make it to <span class="math inline">l-s</span>
appointments on time.</p><p>Assuming <span class="math inline">l-s > 0</span>, then the
outcome of the <em>skip when late</em> strategy is strictly better for
the technician’s supervisor. I can’t imagine there being any incentive
for the supervisor to penalize this strategy. So the technician also
gets off scott free.</p><section class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-section" role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol start=3><li id=fn3 role=doc-endnote><p>“No-shows” are just going to be

technician. But this incentive pattern is everywhere. Even at Google and
s.</p><p>Every time you measure someone’s success on <em>how well</em> they

better strategy.</p><p>One might even argue that this is the cost of doing business and it
would actually makes sense. One customer’s (or user’s or client’s or
patient’s) convenience doesn’t outweigh the convenience of many
others.</p><p>There could be additional complicating factors involved:</p><ul><li><p>What’s the cost of skipping or rescheduling a case? Is the cost
bourne by you? How much of the cost is bourne by the customer?</p></li><li><p>How do you choose which case to skip? It might be that the case
to skip isn’t the one that’s late, but one later down the schedule
that’s much cheaper to reschedule or less damaging to cancel.</p></li></ul><p>In either case, be forgiving when you inevitably find yourself as the
one who got the short end of the stick.</p><p>It just might be that all parties involved are rational actors, and
there’s really not a great alternative. Sometimes it’s just life.</p><nav class=suggested><h2 class=suggested>More articles from this blog</h4><ul><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/remarkable-first-impressions/>Note-taking on a reMarkable 2</a></h3><p>Sentiments after using the reMarkable 2 tablet for a month.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/ephemeral-fingerprinting/>Ephemeral Fingerprinting On The Web</a></h3><p><p>Any ephemeral low-entropy web observable property whose changes are

Ten years ago my wife and I made our way to Mountain View for my orientation; all excited for a brand new chapter in our lives. After spending a week in Mountain View / Palo Alto we both decided that California was not for us. But that’s beside the point.
I was elated. This was pretty much everything I dreamt of as a kid growing up in Sri Lanka.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/mark-goes-up-and-down/>Markdown should be readble without knowing Markdown</a></h3><p>Markdown started out as a way to write text files that could also be machine parsed and rendered into a higher fidelity format.
To quote from the Philosophy:
Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.
This particular aspect of the format wasn’t maintained very well. Immediately following the “Philosophy” section is “Inline HTML” which contradicts the “without looking like it’s been marked up” requirement.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/notes-on-fact-checking/>Notes from Crash Course's Videos on Fact Checking Information You See On The Internet</a></h3><p>Hank Green’s Crash Course YouTube channel has an excellent series
