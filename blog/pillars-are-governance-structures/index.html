<a href=https://xn--izc.com/blog/pillars-are-governance-structures/ aria-label="Permanent link to post"><img src=/images/link-2.svg alt="Permanent link to post"></a></div><p>Re-orgs.</p><p>It’s a fact of life for large organizations. A popular metaphor
making the rounds now ,at least for me, is this concept of pillars. What
was once called teams or simply referred to by their pronoun-less
product names is now called pillars. The metaphor makes sense. Let’s
start at the top.</p><figure><img src=./just-pillars-and-a-goal.png alt="A goal at the top and a bunch of pillars at the bottom. No foundation."><figcaption aria-hidden=true>A goal at the top and a bunch of pillars
at the bottom. No foundation.</figcaption></figure><p>On the top is some kind of goal. The pillars support the goal. There
could be some sort of foundation in the bottom but that never seems to
come up. The metaphor stops before we get to the bottom I guess.</p><figure><img src=./pillars-and-subpillars.png alt="A goal at the top, a bunch of pillars holding it up, and then a bunch of subpillars. Still no foundation."><figcaption aria-hidden=true>A goal at the top, a bunch of pillars
holding it up, and then a bunch of subpillars. Still no
foundation.</figcaption></figure><p>Now things get complicated. Each pillar has subpillars. (I reduced
the number of pillars for clarity.)</p><p>The subpillars are holding up the pillars, I guess. All of them
coming together to hold up the goal or organization. We are using
different words, but nothing is that different from organizations /
teams / and sub-teams.</p><p>Collectively what we are looking at is a system of organizing people.
People can’t seem to agree about how to organize people.</p><p>Pillars or teams are organizational structures. “Leaders” of these
pillars lay out priorities. They are also the advocates of their
respective subpillars and teams.</p><p>Or rather they “should” be.</p><p>In <a href=https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TeamTopologies.html>TeamTopologies</a>
Martin Fowler et. al. discusses different kinds of teams. What applies
to teams applies to pillars – they are the same thing. What I found
compelling was the distinction between <strong>Outcome Oriented
teams</strong> and <strong>Activity Oriented teams</strong>.</p><p>To put it in a nutshell,</p><ul><li><p><strong>Outcome oriented teams</strong> are teams that are
working towards a specific outcome. They hope to achieve some sort of
goal, and once it is achieved the teams either dissolve, or delegate out
to a <em>activity oriented team</em>.</p><p>Outcome oriented teams have specific measurable goals like build a
thing, make specific qualitative change happen, research something, and
achieve a sales goal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Activity oriented teams</strong> are teams that perform
some sort of activity for the organization. They do things like keeping
the lights on, bug fixing, and occasional feature development.</p><p>Activity oriented teams have qualitative goals like uptime,
efficiency, user-satisfaction, and support level.</p></li></ul><p>Activity oriented teams are typically in the service of enabling an
outcome, which would be primarily on the shoulders of an outcome
oriented team.</p><p>There are more details and nuances and much hair-splitting. But the
gist of it can be understood without diving too far into the weeds. What
is important is that …</p><blockquote><p><em>You can’t run a goal oriented team as an activity oriented
team</em> and vice versa.</p></blockquote><p>One can’t set up sensible goals if the modalities doesn’t match up.
And by modalities I mean the type of team.</p><p>And here’s the kicker, the “subpillars” or subteams can support
multiple upstream goals. Especially if they are activity oriented teams.
So our picture actually looks more like this.</p><figure><img src=./pillars-subpillars-and-foundations.png alt="Goals, pillars, sub-pillars, and this time, foundations"><figcaption aria-hidden=true>Goals, pillars, sub-pillars, and this
time, foundations</figcaption></figure><p>In TeamTopologies parlance, these would be – to simplify things a
little bit – enabling teams.</p><p>Notice how the foundations aren’t under specific pillars or (vertial)
subpillars. The problem with the pillars and subpillars model is that
these <em>activity oriented</em> teams don’t fit inside pillars; because
they are <strong>foundations</strong>.</p><p>So the picture actually looks more like:</p><figure><img src=./with-foundations.png alt="Big organization, outcomes, outcome oriented teams, and foundations"><figcaption aria-hidden=true>Big organization, outcomes, outcome
oriented teams, and foundations</figcaption></figure><p>But this isn’t quite satisfactory yet because we can’t made things
fit into the pillar system. Once people get stuck on pillars everything
needs to be a pillar.</p><p>We can, however, stick teams into pillars. These teams would be
outcome oriented if they are stuck into outcome oriented pillars. It
follows that activity oriented pillars will need to be stuck into
activity oriented pillars.</p><p>So it’ll kind of look like this:</p><figure><img src=./all-together-now.png alt="Big organization, goals, outcome oriented pillars, outcome oriented teams, activity oriented pillars, and activity oriented teams"><figcaption aria-hidden=true>Big organization, goals, outcome oriented
pillars, outcome oriented teams, activity oriented pillars, and activity
oriented teams</figcaption></figure><p>And there you have it.</p><p>In reality, the structure can be made much cleaner once you start
asking each team what their goals are.</p><p>But the gist of it is you can’t plan teams or pillars until you know
what their goals are.</p><nav class=suggested><h2 class=suggested>More articles from this blog</h4><ul><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/code-as-ui/>Code As UI: The UX of config-as-code and everything-as-code</a></h3><p>Configuration-as-code has the same usability issues as everything

an oft cited classic in information theory. Let’s dive in and try to

To quote from the Philosophy:
Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.
This particular aspect of the format wasn’t maintained very well. Immediately following the “Philosophy” section is “Inline HTML” which contradicts the “without looking like it’s been marked up” requirement.</p></li></ul></nav><h4>Comment</h4><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=asankah/blog-comments issue-term=title label=PublicComment theme=github-light crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div><div class=pagination><a href=/blog/a-good-api/ class="left arrow">&#8592;</a>
