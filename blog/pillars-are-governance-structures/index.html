with hopefully less rambling.</p></aside><p>Re-orgs.</p><p>It’s a fact of life for large organizations. A popular metaphor
making the rounds now is this concept of pillars. The metaphor makes
sense to some extent.</p><h2 id=a-house-without-a-foundation>A house without a foundation</h2><p>Let’s start with a picture of how a sanitized version of a pillar
structure would look like.</p><figure><img src=./just-pillars-and-a-goal.png alt="A goal at the top and a bunch of pillars at the bottom. No foundation."><figcaption aria-hidden=true>A goal at the top and a bunch of pillars
at the bottom. No foundation.</figcaption></figure><p>On the top is some kind of goal or an organization. In the case of an
organization we can think of organization’s mission as the goal. Pillars
support the goal.</p><h2 id=stage-2-subpillars>Stage 2: Subpillars</h2><figure><img src=./pillars-and-subpillars.png alt="A goal at the top, a bunch of pillars holding it up, and then a bunch of subpillars. Still no foundation."><figcaption aria-hidden=true>A goal at the top, a bunch of pillars
holding it up, and then a bunch of subpillars. Still no
foundation.</figcaption></figure><p>Massive corporations can’t be organized around a handful of pillars.
We need more structure: subpillars.</p><p>The subpillars are holding up the pillars. Together all of them hold
up the goal.</p><p>Collectively what we are looking at is a system for organizing
people. One that is hierarchical and tree structured.</p><p>We all know this. Because that’s what org charts have always looked
like.</p><h2 id=team-topologies>Team Topologies</h2><p>In <a href=https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TeamTopologies.html>TeamTopologies</a><a href=#fn1 class=footnote-ref id=fnref1 role=doc-noteref><sup>1</sup></a> Martin Fowler et. al. discusses
different kinds of software teams.</p><p>One can think of pillars and sub-pillars as being higher level
structures for organizing these teams. Individual teams at the
granularity at which team topologies apply are too granular for
pillars.</p><p>What I found compelling in “Team Topologies” were the concepts of
<strong>Outcome Oriented teams</strong> and <strong>Activity Oriented
teams</strong>. These have always had names – <strong>project
teams</strong> and <strong>service teams</strong>.</p><p>Fowler’s article mentions</p><p>To put it in a nutshell,</p><ul><li><p><strong>Outcome oriented teams</strong> are teams that are
working towards something. They hope to achieve some sort of goal, and
once it is achieved the purpose of the team has been fulfilled and
typically people move on to other things.</p><p>Outcome oriented teams have specific measurable goals like…</p><ul><li>build a thing,</li><li>make specific qualitative change happen,</li><li>research something, or</li><li>achieve a sales goal.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Activity oriented teams</strong> are teams that perform
some sort of activity for the organization. They do things like keeping
the lights on, bug fixing, and occasional feature development. Activity
oriented teams are typically in the service of enabling an outcome.</p><p>Activity oriented teams have qualitative goals like</p><ul><li>uptime,</li><li>efficiency,</li><li>user-satisfaction, and</li><li>level of support.</li></ul></li></ul><p>There are more details and nuances and much hair-splitting. But the
gist of it can be understood without diving too far into the weeds. What
is important is that …</p><blockquote><p>Outcome oriented teams and activity oriented teams can mutually
depend on each other.</p></blockquote><p>Also …</p><ul><li><p>A single outcome oriented team can depend on multime activity
oriented teams.</p><p>For example, a team tasked with building a new service will depend on
multiple existing services that are under the purview of multiple
activity oriented teams.</p></li><li><p>A single activity oriented team can depend on multiple outcome
oriented teams.</p><p>For example, a team tasked with maintaining a critical service will
at times need to implement large changes or features, which require
multiple outcome oriented teams.</p></li></ul><p>Uh oh. Our organization is not tree-shaped anymore.</p><h2 id=its-a-graph>It’s a Graph</h2><figure><img src=./graph-shaped-dependencies.png alt="Interdependencies form a graph, not a tree."><figcaption aria-hidden=true>Interdependencies form a graph, not a
tree.</figcaption></figure><p>The problem is that the the thing we are trying to organize is not
tree structured. Each group has relationships that stretch vertically
along the reporting chain, and also horizontally across “enabling”
teams, support teams, infrastructure teams, or other teams that are
solving similar problems.</p><p>An organization especially at this level of abstraction cannot
represent all this complexity. A large number of free-floating small
teams interacting with each other won’t be very efficient<a href=#fn2 class=footnote-ref id=fnref2 role=doc-noteref><sup>2</sup></a>.
Nor is it conducive to goals at a large scale because that would require
a degree of cooperation that won’t appear spontaneously.</p><p>So we need to steer this pool of teams. It needs some structure so
that some higher level of management can coordinate a number of smaller
groups; so that they can collectively work towards a common but larger
goal.</p><p>With this newfound knowledge we can once again approach the pillars
but this time with goals and activities for the higher level teams.</p><h2 id=its-a-tree-again>It’s a Tree (Again)</h2><p>However, the leadership needs to figure out which of these
relationships to organize around.</p><p>This isn’t quite satisfactory yet because we can’t made things fit
into the pillar system. Once people get stuck on pillars everything
needs to be a pillar.</p><p>We can, however, stick teams into pillars. These teams would be
outcome oriented if they are stuck into outcome oriented pillars. It
follows that activity oriented pillars will need to be stuck into
activity oriented pillars.</p><p>So it’ll kind of look like this:</p><figure><img src=./all-together-now.png alt="Big organization, goals, outcome oriented pillars, outcome oriented teams, activity oriented pillars, and activity oriented teams"><figcaption aria-hidden=true>Big organization, goals, outcome oriented
pillars, outcome oriented teams, activity oriented pillars, and activity
oriented teams</figcaption></figure><p>And there you have it.</p><p>In reality, the structure can be made much cleaner once you start
asking each team what their goals are.</p><p>But the gist of it is you can’t plan teams or pillars until you know
what their goals are.</p><aside id=footnotes class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document" role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn1><p>I don’t believe the concepts introduced in <a href=https://teamtopologies.com/>Team Topologies</a> don’t apply

economy as being a very large number of small “teams” with a very dense
network of interdependencies. Sure, it’s leaving people in poverty and
is killing the planet; but it still kind of works.<a href=#fnref2 class=footnote-back role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a></p></li></ol></aside><hr><nav class=suggested><h2 class=suggested>More articles from this blog</h4><ul><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/why-strong-opinions-weekly-held/>Why 'Strong Opinions Weekly Held'</a></h3><p>Previously on this blog I wrote a short note on Why Strong Opinions Weakly Held.

What Matters To You Typically the actions of an employee within a company depend on their percieved effect on a number of factors. In no specific order, they could be generalized into the following:
The self – a.k.a. self-preservation and self-enrichment. The company – a.k.a. the entity that controls the payroll. When I say “company”, I’m including the entire structure that produces and shares wealth with the employee.</p></li></ul></nav><h4>Comment</h4><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=asankah/blog-comments issue-term=title label=PublicComment theme=github-light crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div><div class=pagination><a href=/blog/a-good-api/ class="left arrow">&#8592;</a>
