kitchen – or MK as we called it – near my desk. There were no baristas
at the time, so people made their own. Some folks thought we could use
more sophisticated coffee beans than they had in the MK. A designated
person would purchase these higher-quality beans using money that
everyone collected in a jar in the MK.</p><p>This cash jar was not locked. Instead, it was in a conspicuous
location, along with a note suggesting that people using the “good”
beans should consider dropping some cash there so that people could
continue purchasing premium beans.</p><p>One day, the cash in the jar went missing.</p><p>The response was swift. Donations poured from everywhere in the
office, offering to replace the lost cash. Noone speculated on who took
the money. Things were back to normal as soon as the incident was
reported. The cash jar was re-instated.</p><p>The cynic in me wondered why the money didn’t get stolen sooner. But
everything worked on the honor system at Google. And we were insistent
on keeping it that way.</p><p>As far as I know, the money never went missing again, though the cash
jar system went away as folks moved around inside the ever-expanding
office.</p><p>Cash isn’t used as much anymore. However, would a similar system work
now? We no longer place as much trust in each other as we did. We don’t
even know most of the people we see walking around. But something is
going on beyond that. Even if we did know the people, we are now more
attuned to insider risk – and justifiably so. As a result, there is more
of an air of distrust.</p><p>What would be the consequences of a breakdown in mutual trust among
employees? In <a href=https://brianlui.dog/2020/10/06/upside-decay/>“Upside Decay,”</a>
Brian Lui argues that such a breakdown in virtue limits an
organization’s ability to benefit from luck.</p><figure><img src=virtuous-cycle.png alt="How a culture of virtue increases the likelihood of collaboration outside of their core work."><figcaption aria-hidden=true>How a culture of virtue increases the
likelihood of collaboration outside of their core work.</figcaption></figure><p>As the diagram indicates, a virtuous culture cultivates
collaboration, leading to successful extra-curricular activity beyond
their core work, which reinforces the culture. Notably, many of Google’s
successful billion-dollar products came about or benefited from
unexpected collaborations that were more or less luck. In a culture of
mistrust, such associations outside of their core work would never have
happened.</p><p>Leadership can identify, plan, and account for some contingencies in
core work. Non-core work, on the other hand, relies on self organization
within the company. That self organization needs trust. Every large
project owes its existence to this non-core work.</p><p>And that’s not all. Some of this work may well become large products
in their own right. Any large tech company will have tons of stories of
this happening repeatedly.</p><p>The importance of “serendipitous collaboration” isn’t lost on
executives. It is the reason behind many pushes for bringing tech
workers back to the office.</p><nav class=suggested><h2 class=suggested>More articles from this blog</h4><ul><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/use-drop-not-edit/>Vim: Use Drop Not Edit, SBuffer Not Buffer</a></h3><p>I’m going to assume you are a Vim user.
Say you have a several windows open in Vim and you want to edit another file. Using :edit works if you want to open the file in the current window unconditionally.
But that’s often not what you want. If you have the same file open in another window, then the most efficient and least disruptive thing to do is to switch to that window.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/visualizing-people/>Visualizing Internet Users</a></h3><p>What does 0.3%1 of internet users look like?
