Course</a>’s excellent series about fact checking information you see on
the internet. The series starts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLlv2o6UfTU">here</a>.</p><h2 id=three-questions>Three Questions</h2><ol type=1><li>How is behind this information?</li><li>What is the evidence for their claims?</li><li>What do other sources say about the organization and its
claims?</li></ol><p>“A question wrongly put.”</p><h2 id=lateral-reading>Lateral Reading</h2><p>All information is produced by someone, and is produced for a
purpose. The lines between motives are unclear. There are always
multiple motives, and they don’t always conflict.</p><p>“Who made this and why?”</p><p>We read websites like we read books. We read vertically. You are only
seeing what the creator wanted you to see. It is often impossible to
tell reliable information from unreliable information.</p><p>A better alternative is to leave the site and search for
corroborating information. Look for conflicts of interest that are left
undisclosed which is a red flag.</p><p>Newspapers can be a good start. These are now digital media
companies. Sometimes they have their own point-of-view. Sometimes these
are stated explicitly and/or are obvious. But that’s not necessarily
always the case.</p><p>There is no magic arbiter of truth. All of these is created by humans
and humans make mistakes.</p><p>“The media” doesn’t exist. It is a large and diverse industry. It is,
however, possible to take these diverse points of view into account.</p><p>You should use Wikipedia. Not every article is perfect, but you
should see verifiable citations.</p><p>Because no source is perfectly objective, one might conclude that no
source is trustworthy. This is not true.</p><h2 id=deciding-whom-to-trust>Deciding Whom To Trust</h2><p>It is easy to be mislead. None of us have the time to be an expert in
everything.</p><p>We have to trust information from outside of ourselves we have to
find a way to accredit and trust experts, even though they will be wrong
some of the time.</p><p>“Listen to me”bloviate””</p><p>Before we place trust in a source, we should verify the authority,
and the validity of their evidence.</p><h3 id=investigating-a-sources-authority>Investigating A Source’s
Authority</h3><ul><li>The author or authors’ professional background.</li><li>The process they used to produce that information.</li><li>The systems that are in place to catch mistakes and correct
them.</li></ul><p>Everyone has a perspective influenced by their lived experience. This
doesn’t necessarily mean that they are unfairly biased. We should take
their perspective into consideration when examining their arguments.
They may be presenting their information in a way that’s persuasive.</p><p>“Opinion”, “Analysis” etc. mean that the work intends to be
persuasive rather than informative.</p><p>STOP, THINK, and LOOK AROUND.</p><p>Each bit of information we have about a source gives us a lens to
filter out their perspective.</p><h2 id=using-wikipedia>Using Wikipedia</h2><p>When used correctly Wikipedia can be a great place to start when
verifying the legitimacy of a source. It’s breadth can exceed any
newspaper. It gives you the general lay of the land when exploring or
researching a topic.</p><p>Wikipedia has become the internet’s largest general reference
work.</p><p>Their content policies:</p><ol type=1><li>A neutral point of view.</li><li>No original research.</li><li>Verifiable.</li></ol><p>Modern Wikipedia has rigorous and robust mechanisms to keep things in
check.</p><p>Wikipedia is not a one-stop shop for in-depth research. Don’t cite
Wikipedia. That’s not a good look. And encyclopedia is not a source.</p><p>Citations help bring up more information from reputable sources.</p><p>Treat Wikipedia as a launch pad.</p><p>Wikipedia is another tool in your information evaluation tool
kit.</p><p>You go there for general overview a topic or a stepping stone to more
references, or to use as one lateral reading source among several.</p><p>And as long as your know how and when to use it appropriately,
Wikipedia can be a great friend.</p><h2 id=evaluating-evidence>Evaluating Evidence</h2><p>As you get older “because I said so” doesn’t cut it anymore. You need
to provide evidence and that evidence should be convincing.</p><p>“What is the evidence?”</p><p>Often when the evidence does not support the claim, it is misleading
or disinformation. Lack of evidence should be suspicious
immediately.</p><p>The mere existence of evidence doesn’t support the claim either.</p><p>Not all evidence is cerated equal.</p><p>The evidence a source provides should come from another reputable
source.</p><p>“Thousands of people never conspire to do anything secretly.”</p><p>Spurious correlation: The implied causal relationship between events
that are coincidentally linked.</p><p>The quality of our evidence like the quality of our information,
affects the quality of our decisions.</p><h2 id=evaluating-photos-videos>Evaluating Photos & Videos</h2><p>Photographs feel real and authentic. Even when images aren’t altered,
they are selectively framed, or have their context falsified (e.g. with
a false explanation, or date).</p><p>We are used to thinking that “seeing is believing”.</p><p>Thanks to their power, images are a very common form of online
evidence. But just like data or text image-based evidence can be
<strong>relevant</strong> and <strong>reliable</strong>, or
<strong>irrelevant</strong> and <strong>unreliable</strong>.</p><p>When you encounter a suspicious image online it is crucial to
investigate who is behind it and whiter they are a reliable source. We
also must verify the surrounding context and whether it supports any
claims being made.</p><p>Use reverse image search on Google to track down sources. Turn to
fact checking sites like Snopes and Politifact.</p><p>Videos can also be dramatically altered. It is important to know
where a video came from, who created it, and whether it’s been altered
before you believe what you see.</p><h2 id=data-and-infographics>Data and infographics</h2><nav class=suggested><h2 class=suggested>More articles from this blog</h4><ul><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/why-strong-opinions-weekly-held/>Why 'Strong Opinions Weekly Held'</a></h3><p>Previously on this blog I wrote a short note on Why Strong Opinions Weakly Held.
I’m trying to get something out every week. Hence the new blog title.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/on-wontfixing-bugs/>On WontFixing Bugs</a></h3><p><p>Large projects accumulate a large number of issue reports over time.
This is normal. Typically for a “successful” project the rate of new
issues being reported will exceed the rate of issues being fixed. Hence
the growth.</p><p>But what are they to do about this ever-growing pile of bugs?</p></p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/mark-goes-up-and-down/>Markdown should be readble without knowing Markdown</a></h3><p>Markdown started out as a way to write text files that could also be machine parsed and rendered into a higher fidelity format.
To quote from the Philosophy:
Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.
This particular aspect of the format wasn’t maintained very well. Immediately following the “Philosophy” section is “Inline HTML” which contradicts the “without looking like it’s been marked up” requirement.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/ansible-cli-sugar/>Easier CLI for ad-hoc Ansible tasks and playbooks</a></h3><p>Encode the host and group names into the name of a wrapper script for
quick ad-hoc invocation of Ansible tasks and playbooks.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/promise-fatigue/>Promise Fatigue</a></h3><p>Setting low but realistic expectations is better than setting high
but unrealistic ones.</p></li></ul></nav><h4>Comment</h4><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=asankah/blog-comments issue-term=title label=PublicComment theme=github-light crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div><div class=pagination><a href=/blog/ansible-cli-sugar/ class="left arrow">&#8592;</a>
