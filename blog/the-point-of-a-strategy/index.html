But why?</p><p>Compared to a more <em>reasonable</em> strategy like start preparing
with plenty of time to spare, invest in a good team, hire a good coach
and what not, <em>why</em> is scoring more goals a dumb strategy? That’s
because the bad strategy didn’t <strong>reduce risk</strong>.</p><p>The whole point of a strategy is to mitigate risk. One could imagine
gathering up a bunch of random people and somehow lucking out at the
game and winning it. You need a strategy if you don’t want to leave
everything to chance.</p><p>That’s why the next strategy you write down needs to account for
these:</p><ol type=1><li><p>State your goal clearly.</p><p>A good goal should clearly articulate <strong>the outcome</strong>,
and <strong>constraints</strong>. E.g. MVP available for limited testing
(<em>the outcome</em>) by end of Q4 (<em>the constraint</em>).</p><p>It should be obvious to anyone when the goal has been reached. This
is by design, since there should not be any question of what you are
collectively trying to accomplish.</p></li><li><p>Identify the risks.</p><p>Mitigating risks begin by identifying them. Some risks are obvouls,
but still write them down because you need to address them.</p><p>Failing to meet the goal is an obvious risk, but why would you fail
to meet the goal?</p><p>A common reasons is simply that you need more time. E.g. you are at
risk of not meeting the constraints due to underestimating the amount of
work required.</p><p>Another reason could be technology you are using not performing as
expected due to bugs. Every part of your tech stack is a gamble. A part
that you don’t own is a specially big risk because you may not be able
to fix it or work around a problem.</p></li><li><p>Figure out how to mitigate the risks.</p><p>At risk of schedules slipping? Have intermediate deliverables and
milestones along the way. Instead of everything falling apart at the
end, you’ll know when things are not going to schedule much earlier in
the product life cycle. Knowing early means that you can address them
before failures snowball into a giant ball of trouble.</p><p>Unreliable tech-stack? Choose stacks that have a solid user base and
support structure. A project with bugs that are getting addressed is a
lower risk than one that hasn’t seen any updates in a year.</p></li><li><p>Stack up your goal, risks, and mitigations.</p><p>There’s your strategy.</p></li></ol><p>It’s not a strategy is risks are not identified and mitigated.</p><p>A common mistake is to write down a list of steps that, if followed,
achieve a stated goal. A good first step. But the unless the strategy
can <strong>reduce</strong> risk, it is not a useful.</p><nav class=suggested><h2 class=suggested>More articles from this blog</h4><ul><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/things-you-can-do-with-nvim-and-vscode/>Things You Can Do With Neovim and Vscode That You Can't Do With Neovim Alone</a></h3><p>This is the third time I’ve tried in earnest to switch to VSCode from Vim (or Neovim in my case) for reasons not all of which are relevant to this post. But I love Vim style modal editing and I’ve grown accustomed to some features that aren’t present or not well emulated in VSCodeVim.
Enter VSCode Neovim. I was intrigued by their claim to integrate Neovim instead of trying to emulate Vim.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/the-lettergrade-rule/>The Lettergrade Rule</a></h3><p>Don’t block a code review because of minor issues that are best left
