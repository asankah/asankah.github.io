<a href=https://xn--izc.com/blog/ten-years/ aria-label="Permanent link to post"><img src=/images/link-2.svg alt="Permanent link to post"></a></div><p>It’s been ten years since I started at Google. The work anniversary
fell on 6th of December.</p><p>Ten years ago my wife and I made our way to Mountain View for my
orientation; all excited for a brand new chapter in our lives. After
spending a week in Mountain View / Palo Alto we both decided that
California was not for us. But that’s beside the point.</p><p>I was elated. This was pretty much everything I dreamt of as a kid
growing up in Sri Lanka. Except those days we dreamt of someday working
for Microsoft or starting our own software company.</p><p>One afternoon during orientation – maybe it was the evening, I don’t
remember – I was walking by a bunch of outdoor tables next to one of the
larger café’s at the Google HQ. As I walked by I overheard a Googler on
the phone telling someone how they just had a really shitty day. I
remember being confused. How could someone have a bad day at Google?
Inconceivable.</p><p>Obviously this feeling didn’t last. People normalize things quickly.
The problem with achieving your dreams is that now you have to make
more; an eternal treadmill. It’s nice to periodically look back though.
The novelty isn’t there anymore, but it’s humbling to recall how much we
dreamt for the things that we now take for granted.</p><p>Looking back at the last years, the things that I’m really proud of
aren’t my code contributions. If any aren’t already obsolete then by now
it’s become some legacy crap that some engineer has to maintain.</p><p>But the things that I really remember are the three times I talked
hiring committees into hiring someone they had decided not to hire.
Those were good candidates whom I thought didn’t get a fair shake.</p><p>Also I clearly remember the smart people who acknowledged and
appreciated my work. I also remember the ones that took credit for my
work or didn’t treat me with dignity, but I don’t think about them that
often.</p><p>I remember the big projects that I initiated, the big ideas I sold,
and the ones I managed to pull off.</p><p>Then there are the low points. Moments when I let people down or
burned a bridge or two for the wrong reasons.</p><p>But overall, looking back there isn’t much there. It’s surprising how
little really matters in the long run.</p><p>I should remember that the next time I feel like staying up late
trying to get something done because I feel some sort of obligation or
bigger purpose in doing it. Often there is none.</p><nav class=suggested><h2 class=suggested>More articles from this blog</h4><ul><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/shannon-paper/>Shannon Paper</a></h3><p>Claude Shannon’s <em>A mathematical theory of communication</em> is
an oft cited classic in information theory. Let’s dive in and try to
tease apart the “why”s that are often overlooked when people build on
top of the introduced theory. They are definitely things that I didn’t
consider to be obvious without the benefit of reading the paper.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/inktober-wild/>Inktober - Wild</a></h3><p>“Wild” - Caught in the wild For Inktober 52.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/why-strong-opinions-weakly-held/>Why 'Strong Opinions Weakly Held'</a></h3><p>Origins of the phrase The title of this blog is Strong Opinions, Weakly Held. The same concept shows up elsewhere are Strong Opinions Loosely Held. An eponymous essay by Paul Saffo in [1] introduced the world to this concept.
In his essay – which isn’t very long if you would like to read the whole thing yourself – he lays out the concept as follows:
