version is more generalized and up-to-date.</p></aside><p>What if you introduce a bug and/or a feature that pisses off a
million people?</p><p>The scenario isn’t all that hard to imagine these days if you work at
a big tech company or even a small one with a considerable user base. It
seems a million users aren’t all that hard to reach these days.</p><p>What is harder though is to imagine what a million people looks like.
What if you were being stared down by the entirety of the affected user
base? Or worse you had to stand on a stage in front of them and explain
yourself?</p><p>If you have 1 billion users and you ship a bug that only manifests 1
in a million times, then you have yourself 1000 angry users. It’s good
to know what that group looks like.</p><p>We can easily imagine a single person, 10, or even 25 people. But
exceed a couple of hundred and our imagination falters. It becomes just
a number and stops feeling like “users” or “people.” The perceived
significance of the population thus starts to diminish.</p><h1 id=so-whats-the-significance-of-a-million-people-anyway>So what’s
the significance of a million people anyway?</h1><p>World population is teetering on roughly 7.7 billion people (in
2019). So <strong>a million people is about 0.01% of the global
population</strong>.</p><figure id=fig:worldpop><img src=world-population-2021.png alt="World population in 2021 is 7.7 billion approximately."><figcaption>Figure 1: World population in 2021 is 7.7 billion
approximately.</figcaption></figure><p>Internet users, on the other hand, come up to something like half of
the world population based World Bank figures which <em>imply</em> that
roughly 50% of the population should have internet access in 2021 <a href=#fn1 class=footnote-ref id=fnref1 role=doc-noteref><sup>1</sup></a>.</p><figure id=fig:internetpop><img src=worldbank-individuals-using-internet.webp alt="Percentage of population who has access to the internet (World Bank 2017)"><figcaption>Figure 2: Percentage of population who has access to the
internet (World Bank 2017)</figcaption></figure><p>So <strong>a million users would be 0.02% of the population with some
access to the internet</strong>. Still not that big.</p><p>But once you focus on a smaller scale like a geographic region or a
user base of some application, then suddenly the million users looks
much bigger.</p><h2 id=to-49>1 to 49</h2><p>Let’s skip this range since this is in the range of what you’d see in
a mirror, can fit on a bicycle, can fit on a sofa, your team, gathering
of friends, significant annual family event, or other familiar
situation.</p><h2 id=from-50-to-100000>From 50 to 100,000</h2><p>An example of visualizing populations for small numbers can be found
at <a href=https://blog.lime.link/visualizing-crowd-sizes/>Visualizing
Crowd Sizes</a>. It goes from around 50 people up to 100,000 people.</p><p>While 100,000 is interesting we need to go all the way to 1
million.</p><h2 id=section>200,000</h2><p>200,000 was the estimated number of people who attended the <a href=https://marchforourlives.com/>March for Our Lives</a> in D.C..
There aren’t any photos capturing <em>all</em> attendees in one shot,
but there are numerous pictures in <a href=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/march-for-our-lives-crowd-size-estimated-200000-people-attended-d-c-march/>this
CBS News article</a> to give you a good idea.</p><p>In more terrible examples, <a href=https://www.dw.com/en/more-than-200000-indonesians-protest-governor-purnamas-alleged-blasphemy/a-36611145>this
article on dw.com</a> suggests that the crowd size pictured is roughly
around 200,000 people.</p><blockquote><p>More than 200,000 conservative Muslims gathered in Indonesia’s
capital Jakarta on Friday to protest against the city’s Christian
governor, who is facing trial for blasphemy, police estimated.</p></blockquote><figure><img src=dw-com-indonesia-protest-2020-11-20.jpg alt="Image from dw.com of a protest in Indonesia allegedly showing 200,000 people. Image Source"><figcaption aria-hidden=true>Image from dw.com of a protest in

discrimination, civil rights abuses against African Americans, Latinos,
and other disenfranchised groups, and support for the Civil Rights Act
that the Kennedy Administration was attempting to pass through
Congress”</em> – drew an estimated 250,000 people according to the
National Park Service.</p><blockquote><p>Rustin coordinated a staff of over 200 civil rights activists and
organizers to assist in publicizing the march and recruiting marchers,
organizing churches to raise money, coordinating buses and trains, and
administering all of the other logistical details. In many ways, the
March defied expectations. The number of people that attended exceeded
the initial estimates made by the organizers. Rustin had indicated that
they expected over 100,000 people to attend - the final estimate was
250,000, 190,000 blacks and 60,000 whites.</p></blockquote><p>(From <a href=https://www.nps.gov/articles/march-on-washington.htm>March on
Washington for Jobs and Freedom – National Parks Service</a>)</p><figure><img src=march-on-washington-1963.jpg alt="Image from nps.gov showing the crowd estimated to be around 250,000 people at the March on Washington on August 28, 1963.

contains 480,000 pixels. So we are now reduced to indicating population
by inference. It is no longer possible to capture 500,000 people in a
webpage sized picture while showing each person individually.</p><p><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/3by9g8/if_this_is_what_500k_people_look_like_xpost_from/>This
Reddit post</a> claims that there are 500k people in the picture, but I
couldn’t readily find any good references backing up that claim.</p><p>Another event that drew 500,000 people is <a href=https://www.nbcnews.com/show-me/video/nearly-500-000-people-march-in-anti-violence-rally-in-barcelona-1033617987741>an
anti-violence rally in Barcelona as reported by NBC</a>. While there’s
video, the content doesn’t quite capture the massive number of people.
Also it’s <em>“nearly 500,000”</em> people.</p><p>However, the closest we’ll probably get to a somewhat believable
500,000 person crowd would be the March for Science. They posted the
following picture on <a href=https://www.facebook.com/marchforscience/posts/836983043362678>Facebook</a>
noting that “There are 500,000 people on strike in Montreal”.</p><figure><img src=march-for-science-crowd-2020-11-20.jpg alt="March for Science on Facebook: Picture of protest. Image source"><figcaption aria-hidden=true>March for Science on Facebook: Picture of

“an Aquarian Exposition: 3 Days of Peace & Music” festival held in
1969 reportedly attracted “over 400,000”, “450,000”, or “500,000” people
depending on the source. Let’s assume that the real number is somewhere
in-between which gets us to somewhere in the neighborhood of 500,000
people.</p><p>There are numerous aerial photos of the Woodstock crowds, some of
which you can find in <a href=https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/woodstock-and-aerial>this
image gallery from Getty images</a>.</p><h2 id=section-3>750,000</h2><p>Off to look at protests again. This time we are looking at Barcelona
where 750,000 Catalan independence supporters are demanding the release
of their leaders according to <a href=http://www.timealem.com/750000-people-flood-barcelona-demanding-release-of-catalan-leaders_d575.html>this
article</a>.</p><figure><img src=barcelona-protest-2020-11-20.jpg alt="750,000 people flood Barcelona demanding release of Catalan leaders. Image source"><figcaption aria-hidden=true>750,000 people flood Barcelona demanding

this is the entire crowd. But you get the general idea. If you ship a
bug that affects 0.01% of the internet population, then this is a
conservative lower bound of what that angry mob would look like.</p><p>But wait, the <a href=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/non-corporate/2018/6/more-than-750-000-people-help-philippines-based-church-achieve-four-new-records-529029>Guinness
World Record for the largest charity walk/run</a> is 283,171 people at a
single venue. Have a look at that picture:</p><figure><img src=guinness-record-largest-walk-single-venu-2020-11-20.jpg alt="Guinness Record for the largest charity walk or run at a single venue is for 283,171 people. Image Source"><figcaption aria-hidden=true>Guinness Record for the largest charity

Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>It seems that picture of 750,000 people doesn’t quite capture that
many people because clearly there are more people in the picture that’s
supposed to be 283k people. Which of course goes to show how hard it is
to really capture how massive a crowd 750k makes.</p><p>In an article on Wired that discusses how hard it is to estimate
crowd sizes, they note<a href=#fn2 class=footnote-ref id=fnref2 role=doc-noteref><sup>2</sup></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Every time a ton of people gather in one place, there are all sorts
of pronouncements made about how many folks really showed. The figures
rarely agree; Glenn Beck’s rally on the National Mall this summer
attracted a million people, according to Beck cohort Rep. Michelle
Bachman. CBS News pegged it at more like 87,000.</p></blockquote><h2 id=and-more>And More</h2><p>I’m going to give up at this point. Pictures purportedly of around
one million people are mostly parts of crowds that have been estimated
to be that big.</p><aside id=footnotes class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document" role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn1><p>Note that fig. 2 indicates that the estimate is 49% of
