<h1 id=requirements>Requirements</h1>
<ul>
<li>Math. Preferably Latex.</li>
<li>Citations. I like to cite stuff.</li>
<li>Figures and pictures and references to thereof.</li>
<li>Be able to export to Github Flavored Markdown.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id=the-stack>The Stack</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>All documents are in Markdown. Specifically <a href=https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html>Pandoc Markdown</a>. Obviously, the source is processed via <code>pandoc</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The site itself is compiled using <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.</p>
<p>The current version (as of this writing) doesn’t support any configuration when using Pandoc for markup processing. By default Hugo only passes the <code>--mathjax</code> option to the <code>pandoc</code> invocation. So I had to make some local modifications so that I can specify filters and some other options to support citations and references.</p>
<p>Pull request is <a href=https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/7529>here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Hugo output – which is a static HTML site – gets pushed out to a separate private GitHub repository.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=https://www.netlify.com/>Netlify</a> monitors this separate GitHub repository and updates this blog.</p>
<p>As a bonus, the generated static content is pushed out to my GitHub Pages site. So there’s an easier to remember URL than <a href=https://අ.com>https://අ.com</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Secondary sites are fed via Pandoc which converts from Pandoc Markdown to Github Flavored Markdown.</p>
<p>Why secondary sites? For various reasons, the primary site for some of the articles need to be their own GitHub repository. E.g. https://github.com/asankah/identity-domains .</p>
<p>For all those sites, the primary source is the blog. That way I can use Pandoc, use citations, use math etc. and things will “just work” when publishing to another site that expects GitHub flavored Markdown.</p></li>

</h3>
<p>I’ve done hundreds of interviews. I’ve also served in numerous hiring committees over the years.
Tech companies tend to have cultures built around tech people interviewing other tech people, typically in what is not-so-affectionately known as the “Tech interview.” This is good because candidates would be evaluated based on their actual skills instead of keywords in their resume. Interviewers are in effect choosing their future coworkers which makes in interview serve the interest of both the interviewer and the interviewee.</p>

<a href=/blog/why-strong-opinions-weakly-held/>Why 'Strong Opinions Weakly Held'</a>
</h3>
<p>Origins of the phrase The title of this blog is Strong Opinions, Weakly Held. The same concept shows up elsewhere are Strong Opinions Loosely Held. An eponymous essay by Paul Saffo in [1] introduced the world to this concept.
In his essay – which isn’t very long if you would like to read the whole thing yourself – he lays out the concept as follows:
I have found that the fastest way to an effective forecast is often through a sequence of lousy forecasts.</p>

<a href=/blog/symbol-name-types/>Names for Name Conventions</a>
</h3>
<p>Names I’ve seen used to refer to naming conventions:
snake_case, hacker_case, unix_hacker_style : Everything is lower case, though exceptions exist. E.g. HTTP_foo_bar. SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE : Usually reserved for macros and constants. camelCase : The first letter is lowercase. PascalCase : The first letter is uppercase. kabob-case : Like snake_case, but uses dashes instead of underscores. Common for command-line options1, CSS styles, commands (e.g. git-receive-pack). While looking idly looking for details on this, I stumbled on this Medium post which is relevant.</p>

<a href=/blog/ephemeral-fingerprinting/>Ephemeral Fingerprinting On The Web</a>
</h3>
<p><p>Any ephemeral low-entropy web observable property whose changes are concurrently observable by multiple sites can lead to cross site identity joining.</p>
<p>This method of identity joining does not require coordination between multiple first parties. A single third party embedded within multiple first parties can also use this method.</p>
