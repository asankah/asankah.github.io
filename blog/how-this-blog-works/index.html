<h1 id=requirements>Requirements</h1>
<ul>
<li>Math. Preferably Latex.</li>
<li>Citations. I like to cite stuff.</li>
<li>Figures and pictures and references to thereof.</li>
<li>Be able to export to Github Flavored Markdown.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id=the-stack>The Stack</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>All documents are in Markdown. Specifically <a href=https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html>Pandoc Markdown</a>. Obviously, the source is processed via <code>pandoc</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The site itself is compiled using <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.</p>
<p>The current version (as of this writing) doesn’t support any configuration when using Pandoc for markup processing. By default Hugo only passes the <code>--mathjax</code> option to the <code>pandoc</code> invocation. So I had to make some local modifications so that I can specify filters and some other options to support citations and references.</p>
<p>Pull request is <a href=https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/7529>here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Hugo output – which is a static HTML site – gets pushed out to a separate private GitHub repository.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=https://www.netlify.com/>Netlify</a> monitors this separate GitHub repository and updates this blog.</p>
<p>As a bonus, the generated static content is pushed out to my GitHub Pages site. So there’s an easier to remember URL than <a href=https://අ.com>https://අ.com</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Secondary sites are fed via Pandoc which converts from Pandoc Markdown to Github Flavored Markdown.</p>
<p>Why secondary sites? For various reasons, the primary site for some of the articles need to be their own GitHub repository. E.g. https://github.com/asankah/identity-domains .</p>
<p>For all those sites, the primary source is the blog. That way I can use Pandoc, use citations, use math etc. and things will “just work” when publishing to another site that expects GitHub flavored Markdown.</p></li>

</h3>
<p><p>Large projects accumulate a large number of issue reports over time. This is normal. Typically for a “successful” project the rate of new issues being reported will exceed the rate of issues being fixed. Hence the growth.</p>
<p>But what are they to do about this ever-growing pile of bugs?</p>

<a href=/blog/things-you-can-do-with-nvim-and-vscode/>Things You Can Do With Neovim and Vscode That You Can't Do With Neovim Alone</a>
</h3>
<p>This is the third time I’ve tried in earnest to switch to VSCode from Vim (or Neovim in my case) for reasons not all of which are relevant to this post. But I love Vim style modal editing and I’ve grown accustomed to some features that aren’t present or not well emulated in VSCodeVim.
Enter VSCode Neovim. I was intrigued by their claim to integrate Neovim instead of trying to emulate Vim.</p>

<a href=/blog/ten-years/>Ten Years</a>
</h3>
<p>It’s been ten years since I started at Google. The work anniversary fell on 6th of December.
Ten years ago my wife and I made our way to Mountain View for my orientation; all excited for a brand new chapter in our lives. After spending a week in Mountain View / Palo Alto we both decided that California was not for us. But that’s beside the point.
I was elated. This was pretty much everything I dreamt of as a kid growing up in Sri Lanka.</p>

<a href=/blog/shannon-paper/>Shannon Paper</a>
</h3>
<p>Claude Shannon’s <em>A mathematical theory of communication</em> is an oft cited classic in information theory. Let’s dive in and try to tease apart the “why”s that are often overlooked when people build on top of the introduced theory. They are definitely things that I didn’t consider to be obvious without the benefit of reading the paper.</p>

<a href=/blog/sometimes-its-the-interviewers-who-suck/>Sometimes It's the Interviewers Who Suck</a>
</h3>
<p>I’ve done hundreds of interviews. I’ve also served in numerous hiring committees over the years.
Tech companies tend to have cultures built around tech people interviewing other tech people, typically in what is not-so-affectionately known as the “Tech interview.” This is good because candidates would be evaluated based on their actual skills instead of keywords in their resume. Interviewers are in effect choosing their future coworkers which makes in interview serve the interest of both the interviewer and the interviewee.</p>
