the author to make. At some point, you’ll agree that the introduced
behavior changes are correct or at least harmless. The remaining
comments are largely stylistic or involve misalignments in minor
architectural choices.</p><p>The letter grade rule is a lens for determining if any remaining
comments justify blocking the change. It goes something like this:</p><blockquote><p>Does addressing your comment or doing what you suggest improve the
reviewed code by at least half a letter grade?</p></blockquote><p>Your comments are not worth blocking the review if the answer is no.
Instead, leave them as suggestions that the author can take and do with
it what they will. Then, move on with your life.</p><p>This route is respectful of the author’s time and yours. It also
implicitly places some amount of trust and responsibility on the author,
which is empowering.</p><p>You might now wonder what constitutes a half-a-letter-grade
improvement.</p><p>Here’s a non-exhaustive list of things it is not:</p><ul><li>Stylistic choices that don’t violate the project’s style guide.
Please choose a coding style and enforce it via a code formatting tool
if this is a common cause of disagreement. Use a code formatting tool
even if it isn’t a common cause of dispute. There should be no reason to
format text with a spacebar in 2022.</li><li>Choice of identifier name; unless the name diverges from the
project’s domain model and naming convention or objectively hurts
readability.</li><li>“This isn’t how I would have done it.”</li><li>There are minor grammar issues or word choices in comments that
don’t decrease the readability of the code. You should be able to trust
the author to make those fixes and submit the change without you having
to do another pass.</li></ul><nav class=suggested><h2 class=suggested>More articles from this blog</h4><ul><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/shannon-paper/>Shannon Paper</a></h3><p>Claude Shannon’s <em>A mathematical theory of communication</em> is
an oft cited classic in information theory. Let’s dive in and try to
tease apart the “why”s that are often overlooked when people build on
top of the introduced theory. They are definitely things that I didn’t
consider to be obvious without the benefit of reading the paper.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/ansible-cli-sugar/>Easier CLI for ad-hoc Ansible tasks and playbooks</a></h3><p>Encode the host and group names into the name of a wrapper script for

The same concept shows up elsewhere are Strong Opinions Loosely Held. An eponymous essay by Paul Saffo in [1] introduced the world to this concept.
In his essay – which isn’t very long if you would like to read the whole thing yourself – he lays out the concept as follows:
