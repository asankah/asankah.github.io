the author to make. At some point, you’ll agree that the introduced
behavior changes are correct or at least harmless. The remaining
comments are largely stylistic or involve misalignments in minor
architectural choices.</p><p>The letter grade rule is a lens for determining if any remaining
comments justify blocking the change. It goes something like this:</p><blockquote><p>Does addressing your comment or doing what you suggest improve the
reviewed code by at least half a letter grade?</p></blockquote><p>Your comments are not worth blocking the review if the answer is no.
Instead, leave them as suggestions that the author can take and do with
it what they will. Then, move on with your life.</p><p>This route is respectful of the author’s time and yours. It also
implicitly places some amount of trust and responsibility on the author,
which is empowering.</p><p>You might now wonder what constitutes a half-a-letter-grade
improvement.</p><p>Here’s a non-exhaustive list of things it is not:</p><ul><li>Stylistic choices that don’t violate the project’s style guide.
Please choose a coding style and enforce it via a code formatting tool
if this is a common cause of disagreement. Use a code formatting tool
even if it isn’t a common cause of dispute. There should be no reason to
format text with a spacebar in 2022.</li><li>Choice of identifier name; unless the name diverges from the
project’s domain model and naming convention or objectively hurts
readability.</li><li>“This isn’t how I would have done it.”</li><li>There are minor grammar issues or word choices in comments that
don’t decrease the readability of the code. You should be able to trust
the author to make those fixes and submit the change without you having
to do another pass.</li></ul><nav class=suggested><h2 class=suggested>More articles from this blog</h4><ul><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/gender-gap-in-adolescent-mental-health/>On Gender Gap in Adolescent Mental Health</a></h3><p>A recent study found that more gender-equal countries have larger

The same concept shows up elsewhere are Strong Opinions Loosely Held. An eponymous essay by Paul Saffo in (2020) introduced the world to this concept.
In his essay – which isn’t very long if you would like to read the whole thing yourself – he lays out the concept as follows:
I have found that the fastest way to an effective forecast is often through a sequence of lousy forecasts.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/a-good-api/>A Good API: g9</a></h3><p>Adding more knobs doesn’t make your API more powerful.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/pillars-are-governance-structures/>Pillars Are Governance Structures</a></h3><p>Re-orgs.
It’s a fact of life for large organizations. A popular metaphor making the rounds now ,at least for me, is this concept of pillars. What was once called teams or simply referred to by their pronoun-less product names is now called pillars. The metaphor makes sense. Let’s start at the top.
A goal at the top and a bunch of pillars at the bottom. No foundation. On the top is some kind of goal.</p></li></ul></nav><h4>Comment</h4><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=asankah/blog-comments issue-term=title label=PublicComment theme=github-light crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div><div class=pagination><a href=/blog/interesting-numbers/ class="left arrow">&#8592;</a>
