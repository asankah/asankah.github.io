the author to make. At some point, you’ll agree that the introduced
behavior changes are correct or at least harmless. The remaining
comments are largely stylistic or involve misalignments in minor
architectural choices.</p><p>The letter grade rule is a lens for determining if any remaining
comments justify blocking the change. It goes something like this:</p><blockquote><p>Does addressing your comment or doing what you suggest improve the
reviewed code by at least half a letter grade?</p></blockquote><p>Your comments are not worth blocking the review if the answer is no.
Instead, leave them as suggestions that the author can take and do with
it what they will. Then, move on with your life.</p><p>This route is respectful of the author’s time and yours. It also
implicitly places some amount of trust and responsibility on the author,
which is empowering.</p><p>You might now wonder what constitutes a half-a-letter-grade
improvement.</p><p>Here’s a non-exhaustive list of things it is not:</p><ul><li>Stylistic choices that don’t violate the project’s style guide.
Please choose a coding style and enforce it via a code formatting tool
if this is a common cause of disagreement. Use a code formatting tool
even if it isn’t a common cause of dispute. There should be no reason to
format text with a spacebar in 2022.</li><li>Choice of identifier name; unless the name diverges from the
project’s domain model and naming convention or objectively hurts
readability.</li><li>“This isn’t how I would have done it.”</li><li>There are minor grammar issues or word choices in comments that
don’t decrease the readability of the code. You should be able to trust
the author to make those fixes and submit the change without you having
to do another pass.</li></ul><nav class=suggested><h2 class=suggested>More articles from this blog</h4><ul><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/poisson-distribution/>Deriving the Poisson Distribution</a></h3><p>Where does the Poisson Distribution come from?
A little bit of research1 tells us that the distribution was originally introduced by Abraham de Moivre in 1710 in an article called “On the Measurement of Chance, or, on the Probability of Events in Games Depending Upon Fortuitous Chance” 2 (not the original title).
A few steps that will get us there is laid out below.

Ten years ago my wife and I made our way to Mountain View for my orientation; all excited for a brand new chapter in our lives. After spending a week in Mountain View / Palo Alto we both decided that California was not for us. But that’s beside the point.
I was elated. This was pretty much everything I dreamt of as a kid growing up in Sri Lanka.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/syntax-highlighting/>On Highlighting Syntax vs. Semantics</a></h3><p>Takes a look at an alternate form of code highlighting based on core
