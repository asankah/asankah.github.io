committees over the years.</p><p>Tech companies tend to have cultures built around tech people
interviewing other tech people, typically in what is
not-so-affectionately known as the “Tech interview.” This is good
because candidates would be evaluated based on their actual skills
instead of keywords in their resume. Interviewers are in effect choosing
their future coworkers which makes in interview serve the interest of
both the interviewer and the interviewee. However candidates – at least
the one who didn’t get accepted according to exit polls – tend to hate
these.</p><p>The goal of the tech interview is to assess how well the candidate
will be able to perform in the role as a tech worker. Unfortunately the
typical problems that one would encounter during the course of a career
in tech aren’t easy to replicate within a 40-60 minute interview. So
partly the criticism is around the fact that such interviews bear little
resemblance to what the actual job would entail. Deciphering what
happens during an interview and distilling it into a prediction of
future success is quite difficult in the best of times.</p><p>Making this much worse is the undeniable fact that many if not most
<em>tech workers are just not good interviewers</em>.</p><p>This is as true as a claim that most tech workers aren’t good
managers – whether it’s managing projects or people. Interview follow-up
don’t take this factor into consideration quite as much as they
should.</p><p>My anecdotal evidence is that when presented with the artifacts from
a bad interview, hiring committees will disproportionately blame the
candidate for it. After all if the candidate was really good, they
would’ve potentially salvaged the interview. The problem
disproportionately affects candidates who are near the middle of the
skill curve where things can probably go one way or the other depending
on the combination of question asked, and caliber of the interview.</p><p>Interviews at Google famously involve a bunch of paperwork where each
interviewer is expected to produce some verbose artifacts detailing what
happened. Since these artifacts come from the interviewer, hiring
committees need to exercise some due diligence to discern what actually
happened based on the writeup. So how do we go about spotting bad
interviews?</p><h2 id=the-writeup-is-terse.>The writeup is terse.</h2><p>Not in and of itself a conclusive sign, but if the writeup doesn’t
have any details that a committee could use to form a decision, it’s
likely a sign that the interview didn’t really gather much information
about the candidate in the first place. Typically these kinds of
writeups are from novice interviewers who don’t know what to write
about.</p><h2 id=the-writeup-uses-adversarial-framing.>The writeup uses
adversarial framing.</h2><p>A very frequent problem specially with novice interviewers is that
they go into the interview thinking that it is some sort of competition
between the interviewer and the interviewee. The interviewer might
consider it a <em>bad</em> thing if a candidate were to hit their
question out of the park. Some of this comes from a certain level of
imposter syndrome where they don’t want to come across as less smart
than the candidate. Either way this mentality comes across during the
interview as hostile or condescending.</p><h2 id=the-interviewer-takes-too-much-pleasure-in-the-interviewees-misery.>The
interviewer takes too much pleasure in the interviewee’s misery.</h2><p>Each mistake is gloated on while points at which the interviewee
obviously shone are muted.</p><h2 id=the-question-is-unnecessarily-hard.>The question is
unnecessarily hard.</h2><p>Solving a hard question that requires a great deal of time and
thought is very satisfying. But it isn’t what you do on a day-to-day
basis.</p><h2 id=the-interviewer-allows-the-interviewee-to-march-into-the-weeds-without-helping-them-back.>The
interviewer allows the interviewee to march into the weeds without
helping them back.</h2><p>The interviewer has the luxury of having seen the question beforehand
and also having studied possible solutions to it. They should be
familiar enough with the question that they could spot
misunderstandings, misconceptions, and common mistakes. How a candidate
notices a misstep and how they dig themselves out is important to note.
However, letting the candidate languish in a dead-end while the clock
ticks away the remaining minutes of an interview does not help
anyone.</p><h2 id=obvious-misunderstandings-are-not-corrected.>Obvious
misunderstandings are not corrected.</h2><p>It is the interviewer’s responsibility to explain the problem
clearly. The problem itself doesn’t need to be fully explained since
there’s much value in seeing how a candidate explores and understands
the problem area. However if it is obvious that the candidate has
fundamentally misunderstood some critical aspect of the question, the
interviewer should step in and intervene <strong>early</strong>. We all
misunderstand things, specially when they aren’t clearly explained. It’s
not useful to knowingly send a candidate down the wrong path.</p><h2 id=the-interviewer-seemed-annoyed-or-angry.>The interviewer seemed
annoyed or angry.</h2><p>This one should be self explanatory. The candidate is anxious enough
as it is. The interviewer should not frustrate the interviewee’s
attempts at asking questions and seeking clarity around the question.
It’s likely that while the problem is obvious to one, the problem area
may be unfamiliar to others who may need extra help figuring their way
around. In fact the ability to resolve such ambiguities and seek clarity
are <em>good</em>. If the interviewer actively discourages such inquiry
that’s on the interviewer – not the candidate.</p><h2 id=one-interview-diverges-significantly-from-others.>One interview
diverges significantly from others.</h2><p>There’s more than one interview for a reason. If one interview
highlights an area as being weak while another interview highlights the
same area as being strong, then there’s something going on that needs
scrutiny. There can be many reasons why a candidate bombs an interview.
Not all of them say anything bad about their ability to function well in
their job. The causes should be teased out.</p><hr><p>What happens when an interview is pretty much unsalvageable? It might
be that the writeup is inconclusive due to issues such as those
highlighted above. A committee could ignore that specific interview and
base their decision on the other interviews, or failing that schedule
another interview to account for the lack of decisive information.</p><p>From a candidate’s point of view, it is <strong>really</strong>
important that they report any unpleasant interactions to one’s
recruiter immediately after the interview. This allows a recruiter to go
to bat for you and perhaps get you another interview if appropriate.</p><hr><nav class=suggested><h2 class=suggested>More articles from this blog</h4><ul><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/darpa-heilmeier-catechism/>DARPA's Heilmeier Catechism</a></h3><p>A set of questions help you think through and evaluate proposed
