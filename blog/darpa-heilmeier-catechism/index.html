staring at a blank page with a vague notion of a problem statement in
your head.</p><p>First you seek structure. After all your attention span can only hold
so much at the same time. In order to tackle larger problems, you need
to reduce large parts of the problem area into intuition. And in turn,
to reduce parts of the problem into intuition, you need to break those
pieces into smaller simpler pieces that you can chew on
individually.</p><p>Losing sight of the forest for the trees is easy during this
process.</p><p>Why were you trying to solve this problem in the first place? Would
you have started if you knew then what you know now about the real scope
of the problem?</p><p>Such concerns are also part of the problem statement; parts that help
your prioritize and select the best solution amongst many. Throughout
all, it’s always good to keep and eye on the prize. That being the end
goal of the exercise. The goal must justify the effort involved. Once
again, for that you need to reduce your motives into intuition.</p><p>The <a href=https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism>“The
Heilmeier Catechism”</a> is “a set of questions […] to help Agency
officials think through and evaluate proposed research programs”. The
list of questions is duplicated here for your convenience. It’s a short
and terse list. Much like what your design sketch should be.</p><ul><li>What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using
absolutely no jargon.</li><li>How is it done today, and what are the limits of current
practice?</li><li>What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be
successful?</li><li>Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?</li><li>What are the risks?</li><li>How much will it cost?</li><li>How long will it take?</li><li>What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?</li></ul><p>(Source <a href=https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism>The

To quote from the Philosophy:
Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.
This particular aspect of the format wasn’t maintained very well. Immediately following the “Philosophy” section is “Inline HTML” which contradicts the “without looking like it’s been marked up” requirement.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/inktober-wild/>Inktober - Wild</a></h3><p>“Wild” - Caught in the wild For Inktober 52.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/comcast-technican-problem/>The Comcast Technician Problem</a></h3><p>Given a set of tasks, incentives are often aligned towards dropping a
