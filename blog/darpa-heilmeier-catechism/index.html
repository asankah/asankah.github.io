staring at a blank page with a vague notion of a problem statement in
your head.</p><p>First you seek structure. After all your attention span can only hold
so much at the same time. In order to tackle larger problems, you need
to reduce large parts of the problem area into intuition. And in turn,
to reduce parts of the problem into intuition, you need to break those
pieces into smaller simpler pieces that you can chew on
individually.</p><p>Losing sight of the forest for the trees is easy during this
process.</p><p>Why were you trying to solve this problem in the first place? Would
you have started if you knew then what you know now about the real scope
of the problem?</p><p>Such concerns are also part of the problem statement; parts that help
your prioritize and select the best solution amongst many. Throughout
all, it’s always good to keep and eye on the prize. That being the end
goal of the exercise. The goal must justify the effort involved. Once
again, for that you need to reduce your motives into intuition.</p><p>The <a href=https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism>“The
Heilmeier Catechism”</a> is “a set of questions […] to help Agency
officials think through and evaluate proposed research programs”. The
list of questions is duplicated here for your convenience. It’s a short
and terse list. Much like what your design sketch should be.</p><ul><li>What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using
absolutely no jargon.</li><li>How is it done today, and what are the limits of current
practice?</li><li>What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be
successful?</li><li>Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?</li><li>What are the risks?</li><li>How much will it cost?</li><li>How long will it take?</li><li>What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?</li></ul><p>(Source <a href=https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism>The

Ten years ago my wife and I made our way to Mountain View for my orientation; all excited for a brand new chapter in our lives. After spending a week in Mountain View / Palo Alto we both decided that California was not for us. But that’s beside the point.
I was elated. This was pretty much everything I dreamt of as a kid growing up in Sri Lanka.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/the-loss-of-a-virtuous-culture/>The Loss of a Virtuous Culture</a></h3><p>Luck isn’t enough.
