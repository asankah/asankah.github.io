staring at a blank page with a vague notion of a problem statement in
your head.</p><p>First you seek structure. After all your attention span can only hold
so much at the same time. In order to tackle larger problems, you need
to reduce large parts of the problem area into intuition. And in turn,
to reduce parts of the problem into intuition, you need to break those
pieces into smaller simpler pieces that you can chew on
individually.</p><p>Losing sight of the forest for the trees is easy during this
process.</p><p>Why were you trying to solve this problem in the first place? Would
you have started if you knew then what you know now about the real scope
of the problem?</p><p>Such concerns are also part of the problem statement; parts that help
your prioritize and select the best solution amongst many. Throughout
all, it’s always good to keep and eye on the prize. That being the end
goal of the exercise. The goal must justify the effort involved. Once
again, for that you need to reduce your motives into intuition.</p><p>The <a href=https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism>“The
Heilmeier Catechism”</a> is “a set of questions […] to help Agency
officials think through and evaluate proposed research programs”. The
list of questions is duplicated here for your convenience. It’s a short
and terse list. Much like what your design sketch should be.</p><ul><li>What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using
absolutely no jargon.</li><li>How is it done today, and what are the limits of current
practice?</li><li>What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be
successful?</li><li>Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?</li><li>What are the risks?</li><li>How much will it cost?</li><li>How long will it take?</li><li>What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?</li></ul><p>(Source <a href=https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism>The

A little bit of research1 tells us that the distribution was originally introduced by Abraham de Moivre in 1710 in an article called “On the Measurement of Chance, or, on the Probability of Events in Games Depending Upon Fortuitous Chance” 2 (not the original title).
A few steps that will get us there is laid out below.
Let’s start with a simple “rate” problem.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/why-strong-opinions-weekly-held/>Why 'Strong Opinions Weekly Held'</a></h3><p>Previously on this blog I wrote a short note on Why Strong Opinions Weakly Held.
I’m trying to get something out every week. Hence the new blog title.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/visualizing-people/>Visualizing Internet Users</a></h3><p>What does 0.3%1 of internet users look like?
As of this writing the global population hovers around 7.7 billion according to the World Population Clock 2.
Screenshot from census.gov showing the world population clock. The International Telecommunications Union “estimates that at the end of 2019, 53.6 per cent of the global population, or 4.1 billion people, are using the internet.”3
Screenshot from itu.int showing historical internet usage numbers as a percentage of the world population So a 0.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/inktober-wild/>Inktober - Wild</a></h3><p>“Wild” - Caught in the wild For Inktober 52.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/symbol-name-types/>Names for Name Conventions</a></h3><p>Names I’ve seen used to refer to naming conventions:
snake_case, hacker_case, unix_hacker_style : Everything is lower case, though exceptions exist. E.g. HTTP_foo_bar. SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE : Usually reserved for macros and constants. camelCase : The first letter is lowercase. PascalCase : The first letter is uppercase. kabob-case : Like snake_case, but uses dashes instead of underscores. Common for command-line options1, CSS styles, commands (e.g. git-receive-pack). While looking idly looking for details on this, I stumbled on this Medium post which is relevant.</p></li></ul></nav><h4>Comment</h4><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=asankah/blog-comments issue-term=title label=PublicComment theme=github-light crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div><div class=pagination><a href=/blog/mark-goes-up-and-down/ class="left arrow">&#8592;</a>
