<p>Thanks to <a href=https://youtu.be/suwg7-y70FQ>Vsauce</a> for bringing this particular issue to our attention. The TL;DR of that video is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the gases in your farts are odorless.</li>
<li>The one that usually makes things stinky is Hydrogen Sulfide.<a href=#fn1 class=footnote-ref id=fnref1 role=doc-noteref><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>The content of H_2_S in a fart is around 50ppm.<a href=#fn2 class=footnote-ref id=fnref2 role=doc-noteref><sup>2</sup></a></li>
<li>One fart can travel around 10 ft/s.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enter <a href=https://www.osha.gov/hydrogen-sulfide/hazards>OSHA</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>H_2_S at a concentration of 50ppm (roughly what you’d get if you inhaled a fart directly into your lungs) you’d suffer <em>Slight conjunctivitis (“gas eye”) and respiratory tract irritation after 1 hour. May cause digestive upset and loss of appetite.</em><a href=#fn3 class=footnote-ref id=fnref3 role=doc-noteref><sup>3</sup></a>.</li>
<li>Any practical dosage would be around 3ppm. At that rate it would be <em>Odor becomes more offensive at 3-5 ppm. Above 30 ppm, odor described as sweet or sickeningly sweet.</em>. The key point here is that around 10 times the usual dosage, a fart won’t stink. Instead it will smell “sweet.”</li>
<li>At 100ppm – which is around 30 times the usual dose – you won’t smell anything at all because you’ll lose your sense of smell (<em>olfactory fatigue or paralysis</em>).</li>
<li>At 1000ppm – 300 times the usual dose – it’s <strong>nearly instant death</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I guess it is in fact possible.</p>
<p>As an aside, I found it quite disappointing that the <strong>Listen</strong> button on the <a href=https://kidshealth.org/en/kids/fart.html>“What’s a Fart” page on KidsHealth.org</a> doesn’t make a fart sound. I mean, what else was that button supposed to do?</p>

</h3>
<p>Origins of the phrase The title of this blog is Strong Opinions, Weakly Held. The same concept shows up elsewhere are Strong Opinions Loosely Held. An eponymous essay by Paul Saffo in [1] introduced the world to this concept.
In his essay – which isn’t very long if you would like to read the whole thing yourself – he lays out the concept as follows:
I have found that the fastest way to an effective forecast is often through a sequence of lousy forecasts.</p>

</h3>
<p>It’s been ten years since I started at Google. The work anniversary fell on 6th of December.
Ten years ago my wife and I made our way to Mountain View for my orientation; all excited for a brand new chapter in our lives. After spending a week in Mountain View / Palo Alto we both decided that California was not for us. But that’s beside the point.
I was elated. This was pretty much everything I dreamt of as a kid growing up in Sri Lanka.</p>

</h3>
<p>I’ve done hundreds of interviews. I’ve also served in numerous hiring committees over the years.
Tech companies tend to have cultures built around tech people interviewing other tech people, typically in what is not-so-affectionately known as the “Tech interview.” This is good because candidates would be evaluated based on their actual skills instead of keywords in their resume. Interviewers are in effect choosing their future coworkers which makes in interview serve the interest of both the interviewer and the interviewee.</p>

<p>Hank Green’s Crash Course YouTube channel has an excellent series about navigating digital information. It’s an excellent guide to how internet users could intelligently consume information they see on the internet. These are my (incomplete) notes from the series.</p>
