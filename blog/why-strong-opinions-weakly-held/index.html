Held</strong>. The same concept shows up elsewhere are <em>Strong
Opinions Loosely Held</em>. An eponymous essay by Paul Saffo in <span class=citation data-cites=Saffo>(<a href=#ref-Saffo role=doc-biblioref>2020</a>)</span> introduced the world to this
concept.</p><p>In his essay – which isn’t very long if you would like to <a href=https://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/>read
the whole thing yourself</a> – he lays out the concept as follows:</p><blockquote><p>I have found that the fastest way to an effective forecast is often
through a sequence of lousy forecasts. Instead of withholding judgment
until an exhaustive search for data is complete, I will force myself to
make a tentative forecast based on the information available, and then
systematically tear it apart, using the insights gained to guide my
search for further indicators and information.</p></blockquote><h2 id=criticism>Criticism</h2><p>Cedric Chin’s critique <span class=citation data-cites=Cedric>(<a href=#ref-Cedric role=doc-biblioref>2020</a>)</span> comes down to
two points that the author summarizes as follows:</p><blockquote><p>In my experience, ‘strong opinions, weakly held’ is difficult to put
into practice. Most people who try will either:</p><ol type=1><li>Use it as downside-protection to justify their strongly-held bad
opinions, or</li><li>Struggle to shift from one strong opinion to another.</li></ol><p>The reason it is difficult is because it works against the grain of
the human mind.</p><p>So don’t bother. The next time you find yourself making a judgment,
don’t invoke ‘strong opinions, weakly held’. Instead, ask: “how much are
you willing to bet on that?” Doing so will jolt people into the types of
thinking you want to encourage.</p></blockquote><p>Michael Natkin on <span class=citation data-cites=Michael>(<a href=#ref-Michael role=doc-biblioref>2020</a>)</span> points out the
fallacy of assuming that strong opinions will be reliably
challenged:</p><blockquote><p>The idea of strong opinions, loosely held is that you can make
bombastic statements, and everyone should implicitly assume that you’ll
happily change your mind in a heartbeat if new data suggests you are
wrong. It is supposed to lead to a collegial, competitive environment in
which ideas get a vigorous defense, the best of them survive, and no-one
gets their feelings hurt in the process.</p><p>[…]</p><p>What really happens? The loudest, most bombastic engineer states
their case with certainty, and that shuts down discussion. Other people
either assume the loudmouth knows best, or don’t want to stick out their
neck and risk criticism and shame. This is especially true if the
loudmouth is senior, or there is any other power differential.</p></blockquote><h2 id=reconciliation>Reconciliation</h2><p>Both cases above illustrate the damage caused by the disconnect
between the holder of the opinion and others about the degree of
confidence with which the opinion is held. A strongly held – and thusly
communicated – opinion has a higher chance of being misinterpreted as
conviction.</p><p>Saffo’s original claim still holds that having a potentially
inaccurate position is <em>better than having none at all</em>. Such a
position elicits arguments and opens up avenues for investigation that
wouldn’t otherwise materialize in the absence of any other catalyst.</p><p>Cedric Chin’s essay points out a simple fix, where the holder of the
opinion also states the degree of confidence. This is meant to dress up
the opinion more as a target than a decree, thus inviting debate instead
of suppressing. I believe this to be good advice.</p><p>Back in my college days, I remember a particularly engaging professor
asking a question like “is claim <em>A</em> true or is claim <em>B</em>
true?” After observing a lackluster show of hands he remarked that of
the three groups of students – those that chose <em>A</em>, those that
chose <em>B</em>, and those that chose neither – the group that will
leave the lecture having learned the most is the group that gets the
answer wrong. He advised all of us to “get some skin in the game,” even
if you don’t know the answer.</p><p>There is some truth to this. Of course a corporate meeting where we
need to elicit debate from a group of people with varying levels of
confidence is a very different venue than a group of students answering
a question. But a similar principle still applies. The goals might be
different, but it’s still better to cajole everyone to get some skin in
the game instead of not passive silence.</p><h2 id=what-strong-opinions-weakly-held-means-to-me>What ‘Strong
Opinions Weakly Held’ Means To Me</h2><ol type=1><li><p>Having an opinion is better than not having one. Accmulation of
raw data is great, but it’s even better when you intentionally accrete
them into something meaningful. Any interpretation of information beyond
establishment of fact is probably going to be in the realm of
opinion.</p></li><li><p>An opinion expressed is better than one that is not as long as
it’s open for criticism. You wouldn’t find out if you were wrong if you
didn’t tell anyone.</p></li><li><p>That it is weakly held is as important to communicate as the
opinion itself. Doing so invites criticism and discussion instead of
suppressing them.</p></li></ol><h2 class=unnumbered id=references>References</h2><div id=refs class="references csl-bib-body hanging-indent" data-entry-spacing=0 role=list><div id=ref-Michael class=csl-entry role=listitem><span>“Strong Opinions Loosely Held Might Be the Worst Idea in Tech -
