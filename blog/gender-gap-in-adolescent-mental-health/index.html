<a href=https://xn--izc.com/blog/gender-gap-in-adolescent-mental-health/ aria-label="Permanent link to post"><img src=/images/link-2.svg alt="Permanent link to post"></a></div><p>Today is the first day of <a href=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/why-the-us-celebrates-womens-history-month-every-march>Women’s
History Month</a>.</p><p>Coincidentally there’s a paper making the rounds titled <em>“The
gender gap in adolescent mental health: A cross-national investigation
of 566,829 adolescents across 73 countries”</em> <span class=citation data-cites=campbell2021gender>[1]</span>, which makes some these
interesting claims:</p><ul><li>Girls have worse average mental health than boys across 4 mental
health measures.</li><li>There is significant heterogeneity in the mental health gender gap
size across countries.</li><li>The gap is most pronounced for psychological distress and life
satisfaction.</li><li>More gender-equal countries have more gender gaps in mental
health.</li></ul><p>The last point, in particular, is a bit of an eyebrow-raiser. So
let’s have a closer look.</p><p>The study uses the <a href=https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2018database/>PISA 2018
dataset</a>, introducing a couple of caveats. Namely:</p><ol type=1><li>All survey respondents were 15 years old; thus, the dataset doesn’t
consider higher education and employment effects.</li><li>The data is from 2018; thus excludes the effects of the pandemic. It
would be interesting to see how the responses change now that people are
coming out of a lengthy lock down.</li><li>Gender was binary. There was no non-binary option.</li></ol><p>The study <span class=citation data-cites=campbell2021gender>[1]</span> derives five measures of
mental health based on the PISA 2018 dataset as follows:</p><ol type=1><li><p><em>“Life satisfaction”</em> measures responses to the question
<em>“on a scale of 0-10, overall, how satisfied are you with your life
as a whole these days?”</em></p></li><li><p><em>“Psychological distress”</em> measures responses to the
question on how often they felt <em>“sad”</em>, <em>“miserable”</em>,
<em>“scared”</em>, and <em>“afraid”</em> on a scale of <em>“never”</em>,
<em>“rarely”</em>, <em>“sometimes”</em>, and <em>“always”</em>. Each
response yields points ranging from 1 through 4, respectively. Summing
the points for each question results in a score of 4-16.</p><p>The survey doesn’t appear to have clarified the difference between
<em>“sad”</em>/<em>“miserable”</em> and
<em>“scared”</em>/<em>“afraid”</em>. PISA 2018 mentions that:</p><blockquote><p>All questions were translated into the languages of participating
countries by two independent linguists and then reconciled by a third to
ensure consistent meaning in all countries.</p></blockquote></li><li><p><em>“Hedonia”</em> measures the responses to the question on how
often they felt <em>“happy”</em>, <em>“lively”</em>, <em>“proud”</em>,
<em>“joyful”</em>, and <em>“cheerful”</em> on the same scale. This
yields a combined scale of 5-20.</p></li><li><p><em>“Eudaemonic wellbeing”</em> measures the degree of agreement
with the below statements. The scale was <em>“strongly disagree”</em>,
<em>“disagree”</em>, <em>“agree”</em>, and <em>“strongly agree”</em>
with a combined score in the range 3-12:</p><ol type=1><li><em>“My life has clear meaning or purpose”</em>.</li><li><em>“I have discovered a satisfactory meaning in life.”</em></li><li><em>“I have a clear sense of what gives meaning to my
life”</em>.</li></ol></li></ol><p>Details of the analysis are in <a href=https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2352827321000173-mmc1.pdf>the
companion document (PDF link)</a>.</p><p>In figure S2 of <span class=citation data-cites=campbell2021gender>[1]</span> shows the distribution of
<em>life satisfaction</em>. Again, developed nations are not doing well
compared with countries like Saudi Arabia.</p><figure><img src=./life-satisfaction-eu.png alt="Distribution of life satisfaction scores for France, Germany, Greece, and Iceland. The range of responses were from 0 through 10. Red is male, and blue is female."><figcaption aria-hidden=true>Distribution of life satisfaction scores

Red is male, and blue is female.</figcaption></figure><p>Compare with:</p><figure><img src=./life-satisfaction-sa-uae.png alt="Distribution of life satisfaction scores for Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. Note that most respondents gave a score of 10."><figcaption aria-hidden=true>Distribution of life satisfaction scores
for Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. Note that most respondents
gave a score of 10.</figcaption></figure><p>I’m skeptical that these numbers represent reality. Unless there’s a
part of Saudi Arabia where adolescents are consistently happy all the
time, these numbers don’t make sense. My skepticism is also extended to
the data from the UAE. <a href=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2021/country-chapters/united-arab-emirates>Human
Rights Watch’s report on the UAE</a> indicates that the UAE is far from
having any semblance of gender equality. Approximately 80% of the
population consists of migrant workers <a href=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/21/thousands-of-children-in-uae-has-no-access-to-schooling-report>who’s
children don’t have access to formal education</a>. It’s unlikely that
these children of migrants participated in the study.</p><p>The curve fitting for the resulting graphs is what tells the stories
that are summarized at the start of this post. The axes are arranged so
that moving towards the right and moving upwards indicate better
conditions. Hence it’s apparent from the curves that male life
satisfaction is pretty consistent and not affected all that much by
GII<a href=#fn1 class=footnote-ref id=fnref1 role=doc-noteref><sup>1</sup></a>. Meanwhile, female life satisfaction
trends <em>downward</em> as GII improves; hence the conclusion that more
gender equality implies less happiness.</p><p>GSNI (Gender Social Norms Index) is also negatively correlated with
quality-of-life measures (where we put “good” on the high end and “bad”
on the low end).</p><figure><img src=./life-satisfaction-vs-other-indicators.png alt="Life satisfaction plotted against per-capita GDP, Gini index, GII, GSNI, GGGI. The curves don’t quite fit very well."><figcaption aria-hidden=true>Life satisfaction plotted against
per-capita GDP, Gini index, GII, GSNI, GGGI. The curves don’t quite fit
very well.</figcaption></figure><p>All the graphs show a high variance. Only a small number of countries
are present in the study. And whether the subjects of the study are
representative of the population is in doubt. Overall I find the study
unconvincing.</p><h2 class=unnumbered id=references>References</h2><div id=refs class="references csl-bib-body" role=doc-bibliography><div id=ref-campbell2021gender class=csl-entry role=doc-biblioentry><div class=csl-left-margin>[1]</div><div class=csl-right-inline>O.

But I love Vim style modal editing and I’ve grown accustomed to some features that aren’t present or not well emulated in VSCodeVim.
Enter VSCode Neovim.

I’ve also served in numerous hiring committees over the years.
Tech companies tend to have cultures built around tech people interviewing other tech people, typically in what is not-so-affectionately known as the “Tech interview.” This is good because candidates would be evaluated based on their actual skills instead of keywords in their resume. Interviewers are in effect choosing their future coworkers which makes in interview serve the interest of both the interviewer and the interviewee.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/git-autopush/>Use Git hooks to automatically push after every commit</a></h3><p>During before and after various Git operations, Git invokes special
