earlier developer days I strongly believed that all projects should go
for this target. At a company all-hands I heard from a senior engineer
that having zero technical debt is often not what we want. I felt
betrayed.</p><p>Why is it that zero technical debt isn’t what we want?</p><h2 id=memory-allocation-strategy-leak-all-allocations>Memory
Allocation Strategy: Leak All Allocations</h2><p>Let’s take a moment and think of a hypothetical program. If you knew
that your program ran once and terminated, would you go through the
effort of deallocating each individual memory allocation at the end? You
are about to end the process and drop the entire heap anyway. Cleaning
the heap at this point is a waste. For short-lived programs who’s memory
consumption is bounded and less than the available memory the more
efficient strategy is to just leak all memory.</p><p>One might wonder if such a strategy would break reusability. “Leak
all allocations” doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t call
<code>free()</code> (or equivalent) in your code. It means that the
memory manager would treat <code>free()</code> as a no-op. This
principal also applies to garbage collected languages. After all, the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20100809-00/?p=13203#:~:text=Garbage%20collection%20is%20simulating%20a%20computer%20with%20an%20infinite%20amount%20of%20memory."><em>job
of memory management is to simulate infinite memory</em></a>. If you are
only going to use a finite amount of memory then you don’t need memory
management.</p><h2 id=what-does-just-enough-technical-debt-look-like>What Does Just
Enough Technical Debt Look Like?</h2><p>Some of the motivation for stopping short of perfect comes from the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month>Mythical
Man Month</a>.</p><blockquote><p>For the human makers of things, the incompletenesses and
inconsistencies of our ideas become clear only during implementation.
Thus it is that writing, experimentation, “working out” are essential
disciplines for the theoretician.</p><p>― Frederick P. Brooks Jr., The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software
Engineering</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The hardest part of the software task is arriving at a complete and
consistent specification, and much of the essence of building a program
is in fact the debugging of the specification.</p><p>― Frederick P. Brooks Jr., The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software
Engineering</p></blockquote><p>Software projects tend to be characteristically similar. Putting too
much effort into a project features you don’t need and polishing up code
that nobody will reuse is wasteful. It’s just a little bit harder to
know when you’ve crossed the point of diminishing returns where cleaning
up the code no longer makes sense.</p><hr><nav class=suggested><h2 class=suggested>More articles from this blog</h4><ul><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/syntax-highlighting/>On Highlighting Syntax vs. Semantics</a></h3><p>Takes a look at an alternate form of code highlighting based on core
