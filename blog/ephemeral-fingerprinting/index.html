<a href=https://xn--izc.com/blog/ephemeral-fingerprinting/ aria-label="Permanent link to post"><img src=/images/link-2.svg alt="Permanent link to post"></a></div><p>TL;DR:</p><ul><li><p>Any web observable property whose changes are concurrently observable by multiple top-level sites can lead to cross site identity joining.</p></li><li><p>This method of identity joining does not require additional coordination between multiple first parties. A single third party embedded within multiple first parties can also use this method.</p></li></ul><h2 id=background>Background</h2><figure><img src=/images/isolation-boundaries.png alt="diagram of site isolation boundaries with overlap"><figcaption aria-hidden=true>diagram of site isolation boundaries with overlap</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Two sites observe a sequence of device orientation changes at times ùíï‚ÇÄ, ùíï‚ÇÅ,ùíï‚ÇÇ .</p><p>All sites on the same UA instance share a clock and therefore can agree on the timestamps with a small margin of error. The triplet ùíï‚ÇÄ, ùíï‚ÇÅ,ùíï‚ÇÇ has a high probability of uniquely identifying the user. The two sites can thus use these observations to conclude that the observations originate from the same user.</p><p>As illustrated above, one or more low entropy signals observed concurrently can be used to identify a user with a high degree of confidence. Let‚Äôs call these <strong>ephemeral fingerprints</strong>. This document discusses two types:</p><ol type=1><li><p><em>The sequence of timestamps corresponding to observed changes of a volatile surface can be used for identification</em>. Let‚Äôs call these <strong>correlated events</strong>.</p></li><li><p><em>A stream of observations of a volatile surface can be identifying</em>. Let‚Äôs call these <strong>unique event streams</strong>.</p></li></ol><p>Signals considered for ephemeral fingerprinting don‚Äôt need to be highly identifying by themselves. The <a href=https://github.com/bslassey/privacy-budget>privacy budget proposal</a> does not adequately account for fingerprinting based on concurrent observations of low entropy signals.</p><p>Device orientation, from our earlier example, can take one of two values (portrait or landscape) and is unstable. Thus a single sample of device orientation carries almost no information. I.e. A recorded observation of device orientation doesn‚Äôt help at all with identifying the user at a later time. However the timestamps corresponding to orientation changes could have identifying levels of entropy.</p><p>These are not new. For example, this is discussed by Van Goethem et. al.¬†<a href=#fn1 class=footnote-ref id=fnref1 role=doc-noteref><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>who calls these ‚ÄúCross-Session Events‚Äù (¬ß 5 of linked paper). Potential ephemeral fingerprinting surfaces also get flagged during standardization discussions ( <a href=https://github.com/w3c/mediacapture-main/issues/403>Example: Polling enumerateDevices</a>, <a href=https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-privacy/2013JanMar/0007.html>Example: Ambient light events</a>).</p><h3 id=modelling-correlated-events>Modelling Correlated Events</h3><p>A correlatable event can be thought of as the tuple <code>&lt;surface-sample, timestamp></code>.

For example, the Media Capture API specification includes the following:</p><blockquote><p>For origins to which permission has been granted, the devicechange event will be emitted across browsing contexts and origins each time a new media device is added or removed; user agents can mitigate the risk of correlation of browsing activity across origins by fuzzing the timing of these events.</p></blockquote><p style=text-align:right>From ¬ß15 of <a href=https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#privacy-and-security-considerations>Media Capture and Streams API</a> specification.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Prevents drive-by fingerprinting.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li><p>UI for permissions don‚Äôt disclose the fact that all sites that have been granted access to the same resource can synchronize identifiers as a side-effect.</p></li><li><p>Doesn‚Äôt prevent identity joining once permission is granted.</p></li></ul><h3 id=fuzzing-timing-of-events>Fuzzing Timing of Events</h3><p><strong>Goal</strong>: Deter correlation of events by injecting timing skew.</p><p>Mentioned in the snippet above from the Media Capture and Streams API and called out by Jeffrey Yasskin as a potential general mitigation in ‚Äúdesynchronize whole-browser events‚Äù in <a href=https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5215>this issue</a> filed against the WHATWG HTML specification.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Lowers confidence of identity equivalence.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li><p>Precise timing may not be required.

But third-party contexts can‚Äôt ‚Äúreach across‚Äù browsing contexts via correlation of cross context events or attributes that may be made available by the API.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Makes it a requirement that first-parties actively cooperate with other first-parties or third-parties. I.e. Good first-party + bad third-party = safe.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li><p>Difficult to retrofit into existing APIs.</p></li><li><p>Browser-wide events and attributes are still visible to distinct top-level browsing contexts.</p></li><li><p>In practice top-level browsing contexts contain a fair amount of third party scripts which may access the same APIs.
