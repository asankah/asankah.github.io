<a href=https://xn--izc.com/blog/optimal-line-length/ aria-label="Permanent link to post"><img src=/images/link-2.svg alt="Permanent link to post"></a></div><p>As you could probably tell from the general look and feel of this
site, it derives some amount of inspiration from <a href=https://medium.com>Medium</a><a href=#fn1 class=footnote-ref id=fnref1 role=doc-noteref><sup>1</sup></a>. The two important
aspects that I find attractive on Medium are:</p><ol type=1><li>Typography. The font pairings are easy on the eyes.</li><li>Text width. Also easy on the eyes, but for a different reason. It
seems to lend itself to easy reading.</li></ol><p><strong>Linotype newspapers had narrow columns for practical
reasons</strong>. Not necessarily the ergonomics of the reader, but
rather the publisher.</p><p>A metal line of type (“<em>line-o-type</em>” ⇝ <em>linotype</em>)
also called a <em>slug</em> becomes difficult to work with if it is too
long. In particular, the machines assembled text line-by-line. The
process requires that all the lines are of equal width. A small line
width – 2 inches in this case – was apparently the right trade-off.</p><figure><img src=./linotype-slug.png alt="A linotype “slug” is a block of lead that has letter shaped extrusions on one side.

has letter shaped extrusions on one side. (Image source: <a href=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Linotype_Gusszeile_-_Type_Slug.jpg>Wikimedia</a>

easier to find the start of the next line after reading one. Line
spacing helps; double-spacing isn’t just a trick to reach push the page
count.</p><figure><img src=./line-tracking.png alt="An eyeball moves from the end of one line to the next and then moves to the beginning of the next line."><figcaption aria-hidden=true>An eyeball moves from the end of one line
to the next and then moves to the beginning of the next
line.</figcaption></figure><p>So the goal here is to figure out a width that is short enough that
the reader can find the next line comfortably, and long enough to not
require excessive effort to read each line. Oh and one more thing;
newspapers – or print in general – is different from reading on the web
in terms of distance from the eye to the text. That also affects line
tracking and saccadian movement.</p><figure><img src=./reading-effort-system.png alt="System diagram showing the optimization problem of reading comfort.

times
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698901000256</p><p>As people read continuous text, on occasional single eye fixations
the text was replaced by one of six alternate stimulus patterns.
Frequency distributions of the durations of these fixations were used to
test predictions from four types of theories of saccadic eye movement
control. Contrary to current cognitive theories, cognitive influences
appeared to delay saccades rather than trigger them. Two saccade
disruption times were identified, suggesting the existence of three
distributions of saccades, labeled early, normal and late. The
Competition–inhibition theory, an enhanced version of Findlay and
Walker’s (1999) theory, is proposed to account for eye movement control
during reading.</p></li><li><p>F-Shaped Pattern of Reading on the Web: Misunderstood, But Still

https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/ On the
average Web page, users have time to read at most 28% of the words

A few steps that will get us there is laid out below.
