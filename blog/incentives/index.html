<a href=https://xn--izc.com/blog/incentives/ aria-label="Permanent link to post"><img src=/images/link-2.svg alt="Permanent link to post"></a></div><p>Let’s talk about incentives and psychological safety.</p><h2 id=what-matters-to-you>What Matters To You</h2><p>Typically the actions of an employee within a company depend on their
percieved effect on a number of factors. In no specific order, they
could be generalized into the following:</p><ol type=1><li><strong>The self</strong> – a.k.a. <em>self-preservation and
self-enrichment</em>.</li><li><strong>The company</strong> – a.k.a. <em>the entity that controls
the payroll</em>. When I say “company”, I’m including the entire
structure that produces and shares wealth with the employee. Management
structures, co-workers (in their professional roles <a href=#fn1 class=footnote-ref id=fnref1 role=doc-noteref><sup>1</sup></a>),
and other stakeholders all get lumped into “company” for convenience.
The employee – whom we are assuming is not very high up in the org-chart
– is affected by, but typically has little effect on these entities.
Lumping all those entities into the single “company” entity keeps things
simple for now.</li><li><strong>The customers or users</strong> – a.k.a. <em>whom the
employees see as they ultimately serve</em>.</li><li><strong>Society</strong> – a.k.a. <em>among whom the employee
lives</em>.</li><li><strong>The environment and the planet</strong> – a.k.a.
<em>everything and everyone else</em>.</li></ol><p>When presented with a decision like what to do when something goes
wrong, the employee will weigh the percieved effect of their decision on
each of these entities. Such a consideration may not happen consciously,
especially in the heat of the moment. However over time people tend to
build up their own intuition around what works and what doesn’t. The
ambient culture has a lot to do with the formation of these
intuitions.</p><p>It is this intuition that we seek to affect with the culture that we
build around ourselves.</p><p>It’s safe to assume that in general everyone will hold themselves at
the top of this list. That leaves us with how we organize the remainder
relative to the self.</p><p>In an ideal world, the interests that benefit each of these will have
no conflicts. The society in general will seek to look after each other
and the environment. Individuals – the customers and users – in turn
will seek sustainable goods and services that benefit society in
addition to meeting their immediate needs. The company will seek to
produce such goods and services; and set up incentives for their
employees to do so.</p><h2 id=a-culture-of-mutual-respect-and-safety>A Culture of Mutual
Respect and Safety</h2><p>One of the more successful concepts at Google is the
<strong>blameless postmortem</strong>. The <a href=https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/>SRE Book’s
section on postmortem culture</a><a href=#fn2 class=footnote-ref id=fnref2 role=doc-noteref><sup>2</sup></a> explains it in detail.
But the most relevant bit for this article is as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Removing blame from a postmortem gives people the confidence to
escalate issues without fear. It is also important not to stigmatize
frequent production of postmortems by a person or team. An atmosphere of
blame risks creating a culture in which incidents and issues are swept
under the rug, leading to greater risk for the organization</p></blockquote><p>A cultural cornerstone the likes of a blameless postmortem naturally
guides people towards a way of thinking that is outward facing. Since
there is no risk to self an employee is much more likely to act towards
the benefit of others. This is especially true if “doing the right
thing” is rewarded.</p><p>What happens when people feel constantly at risk is easy to see.
Faults get swept under the rug, as the SRE book points out. Things that
negatively affect the quality of good and services produced will remain
unaddressed. Users lose trust in the company. Ultimately everything goes
downhill.</p><h2 id=current-events-at-google>Current Events at Google</h2><p>A well respected engineer with a long tenure, Ian Hixie, recently
left Google.</p><p>After he left, he wrote <a href="https://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1700627373&amp;count=1">a blistering
reflection of where Google is heading</a>. You should read it.</p><p>One thing that he points out are the results of the recent layoffs at
Google:</p><blockquote><p>The effects of layoffs are insidious. Whereas before people might
focus on the user, or at least their company, trusting that doing the
right thing will eventually be rewarded even if it’s not strictly part
of their assigned duties, after a layoff people can no longer trust that
their company has their back, and they dramatically dial back any
risk-taking. Responsibilities are guarded jealously. Knowledge is
hoarded, because making oneself irreplaceable is the only lever one has
to protect oneself from future layoffs.</p></blockquote><h2 id=section></h2><aside id=footnotes class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document" role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn1><p>Co-workers in their personal roles like friends and
community likely falls into the “society” bucket.<a href=#fnref1 class=footnote-back role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a></p></li><li id=fn2><p>The bibliography links from that page are quite
informative in learning about the philosophy of blameless postmortems –
and in general a blameless culture. While interesting, that general
topic is out of scope for this article.<a href=#fnref2 class=footnote-back role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a></p></li></ol></aside><hr><nav class=suggested><h2 class=suggested>More articles from this blog</h4><ul><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/remarkable-first-impressions/>Note-taking on a reMarkable 2</a></h3><p>Sentiments after using the reMarkable 2 tablet for a month.</p></li><li><h3 class="suggested title"><a href=/blog/inktober-decay/>Inktober - Decay</a></h3><p>“Decay” - I was kind of going for tooth-decay caused by tiny little gremlins.

Say you have a several windows open in Vim and you want to edit another file. Using :edit works if you want to open the file in the current window unconditionally.
But that’s often not what you want. If you have the same file open in another window, then the most efficient and least disruptive thing to do is to switch to that window.</p></li></ul></nav><h4>Comment</h4><script src=https://utteranc.es/client.js repo=asankah/blog-comments issue-term=title label=PublicComment theme=github-light crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div><div class=pagination><a href=/blog/pillars-are-governance-structures/ class="left arrow">&#8592;</a>
