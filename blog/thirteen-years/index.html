years since I joined Google.</p><p>Of the people who started at Google that day just a hair over 50% are
still at Google. Glancing through the list<a href=#fn1 class=footnote-ref id=fnref1 role=doc-noteref><sup>1</sup></a> I
see a couple of folks who have left for greener pastures or pursuing
something on their own. Others who are still here have made their way up
the organizational ladders.</p><p>But for everyone on that list the Google of today is not the Google
we joined all those years ago. Someone who had been at Google much
longer than I have <a href="https://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1700627373&amp;count=1" title="Ian Hixie's blog: Reflecting on 18 years at Google">recently
published their thoughts</a> after they left Google. They had good
things to say about Google, but they also had some pretty harsh things
to say. I can’t comment about some of the specifics they mentioned but
the general sentiment checks out.</p><p>Avery Pennarun<a href=#fn2 class=footnote-ref id=fnref2 role=doc-noteref><sup>2</sup></a> wrote a post that I think touches on
something relevant and important. The post is called <a href=https://apenwarr.ca/log/20190926 title="What do executives do anyway?">What do executives do anyway?</a>.
To save you a read (though you really should add it to your <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/7343019?hl=en" title="Read pages later & offline">reading list</a>), the salient
points are:</p><ul><li>An executive’s <strong><em>only</em></strong> job is to <em>“enforce
<strong>culture and values</strong> for their whole
organization.”</em><a href=#fn3 class=footnote-ref id=fnref3 role=doc-noteref><sup>3</sup></a></li><li>The executives set and enforce the values. The rest of the company
comes up with strategies accordingly.</li><li><em>“In a large organization, executives don’t set strategy.”</em> …
<em>“It’s an illusion to believe you can enforce a strategy.”</em></li><li>Useful organizational values involve real tradeoffs.</li></ul><p>People have a common misconception that all employees of big
companies are constantly thinking of the bottom line. This is not the
case. Precious few teams can draw a clear line from their day-to-day
work to any measurable change in the company’s performance<a href=#fn4 class=footnote-ref id=fnref4 role=doc-noteref><sup>4</sup></a>. So
at an individual level, decisions are influenced by concerns much closer
to themselves: things like base pay, career, admiration of their peers,
and their own sense of accomplishment.</p><p>There are many things that an individual can work on to satisfy their
immediate concerns. The <em>culture and values</em> of a company help
narrow these options down to those that benefit everyone.</p><p>The reason I brought up the topic of culture and values is because
Google has a vacuum where an inspiring vision once was. Layoffs wreaked
havoc with the trust that people had for each other and themselves. We
are still <em>trying</em> to <a href=https://about.google/philosophy/ title="Ten things we know to be true">focus on the user</a>; <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/january-update/#:~:text=important%20moments%20to-,sharpen%20our%20focus,-%2C%20reengineer%20our%20cost" title="A difficult decision to set us up for the future">sharply, in

It’s a fact of life for large organizations. A popular metaphor making the rounds now is this concept of pillars. The metaphor makes sense to some extent.
A house without a foundation Let’s start with a picture of how a sanitized version of a pillar structure would look like.

In his essay – which isn’t very long if you would like to read the whole thing yourself – he lays out the concept as follows:
