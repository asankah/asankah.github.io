        <h2 id="embrace-imperfection">Embrace Imperfection</h2>
        <p>A factor that led to Google’s early success was the use of commodity
          hardware instead of purpose built super computers as was the custom at
          the time. What they realized was that instead of demanding perfection
          from complex systems it is far more effective to accept the
          imperfections and design with it or around it<span class="citation" data-cites="srebookChap2"><a href="#ref-srebookChap2" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span>.</p>
        <h2 id="because-we-are-imperfect">Because We Are Imperfect</h2>
        <p>We are good at some things but not at others. Any team under the
          right set of incentives wll gradually anneal into an amalgamation where
          people will expand or contract their “official” roles until the they can
          get work done efficiently. This means that in general:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The role that one inhabits in a team will be different from their
            official job description.</li>
          <li>Roles will overlap in ways that will run counter to the intents of
            the official role allocations.</li>
          <li><em>Roles will emerge that are not mentioned in anyone’s job
description.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="sidenote-host-1">
          <p>If people ridigly perform just their roles and let things fail around
            them (<em>“it’s not my job”</em>), that’s not a problem with the
            individual themselves. It’s a problem with management; either because
            they don’t understand or appreciate the necessary work that people are
            doing, or the incentives are just poorly arranged.</p>
          <p>The right incentives can only be put in place by leadership that is
            aware of their own limitations and acknowledge their own imperfections.
            That’s because those incentives need to leave enough room for others to
            compensate. In other words, the only system that can reasonably create
            the right incentives is one where the at least some authority of
            deciding compensation is laid in the hands of those who observe work
            directly.</p>
          <p>See <a href="/posts/intrinsic-motivation-an-anecdote/">Intrinsic and
              Extrinsic Motivation: An Anecdote</a> for an example of what happens
            when people try to force this process purely by creating extrinsic
            incentives and assigned roles.</p>
        </div>
        <section id="no-heros" class="sidenote-1">
          <h4>No Heros</h4>
          <p>Any organization whose success depends on their employees working
            <em>against</em> their own self interests will eventually fail.
          </p>
          <p>Unfortunately incentives are seldom arranged by people who understand
            what organizational cross beams are necessary to keep the
            <em>“official”</em> role hierarchy from collapsing. Leadership rarely
            hear you work till 2am, but they will hear the failure of their
            leadership eventually … and until then they will neither understand nor
            act.
          </p>
        </section>
        <h2 id="organizational-cross-beams">Organizational Cross Beams</h2>
        <p>So assuming there is some alignment of incentives, a number of roles
          will emerge in an organization that are seldom officially recognized in
          any role profile.</p>
        <p>Broadly speaking there are two types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Glue-people</strong> who are necessary to tie teams
              together, build cohesion, connect the dots between silos that are not
              effectively communicating with each other, and establish an unofficial
              foundation of trust that prevent teams from collapsing when the trust
              between leadership and workers inevitably crumble occasionally.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Immune Systems</strong> are the people necessary to stop
              the company from shooting themselves in their corporate feet. These are
              the people who internally oppose measures that would cause widespread
              collapse of crucial user-trust, violate privacy policies, open up the
              organization to litigation, irreversibly misuse customer data,
              unnecessarily jeopardize the operational stability or security of
              critical systems, or commit war crimes and human rights
              violations.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>With the remaining few paragraphs, I’d like to focus on the first
          one. The second demands its own article.</p>
        <h2 id="glue-people">Glue People</h2>
        <p>Glue people are intrinsically motivated unassigned organizational
          roles. They perform a valuable function by being social hubs (sometimes
          also referred to as <em>human indexers</em>) where both work and
          non-work related information flow freely in a manner that is usually at
          odds with upper management.</p>
