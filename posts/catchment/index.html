        <p>A major impact of such government activity is the loss of enrollments

            <p>European Enlightenment ideas, particularly from thinkers like John
              Locke, migrated to the American colonies, influencing a distinct
              American intellectual identity focused on reason, self-governance, and
              scientific progress. This intellectual capital was concentrated in East
              Coast port cities, which served as nexuses for transatlantic trade and
              communication. The founding of the nine colonial colleges, such as
              Harvard, Yale, and the College of Philadelphia, solidified these urban
              centers as the primary hubs of early American intellect, attracting
              scholars and students and creating an environment for the dissemination

            <p>The Morrill Acts were a pivotal federal policy that drove the
              westward and southern migration of intellectual capital. By granting
              federal lands to states to establish public colleges focused on
              ‘agriculture and the Mechanic arts,’ the acts spurred the creation of
              new intellectual centers across the country, particularly in the Midwest
              and West. This deliberately shifted the focus from the classical
              education of the East Coast to a more practical, democratized form of
              knowledge. The Second Morrill Act of 1890 furthered this distribution by
              mandating the creation of separate institutions for Black students in
              former Confederate states, leading to the establishment of numerous
              Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and fostering
              intellectual capital within African American communities in the
              South.</p>

              attracted scholars and established a high-level intellectual center away
              from the East Coast. Simultaneously, waves of European immigrants,
              including a significant number of inventors and scientists like Nikola
              Tesla, brought their intellectual capital to the U.S., contributing to
              burgeoning sectors like electricity and chemicals. This represented a

          <p>Just as a physical reservoir relies on its hydro-catchment area to
            replenish their water supply, intellectual endeavors are similarly
            dependent on “intellectual catchment areas” —-regions, either physical
            or conceptual, that gather and channel information, ideas, and
            talent.</p>
          <p>As a hydro-catchment area’s health dictates the long-term viability
            of its reservoir; so does the richness and connectivity of an
            intellectual catchment area directly influence the sustained vitality
            and growth of intellectual pursuits.</p>
          <p>Without these intellectual catchment areas, the wellspring of
            creativity and innovation for a particular field or project risks drying
            up.</p>

        <p>Over many decades, particularly starting towards the end of the
          second world war, the United States has decidedly become a reservoir of
          intellectual capital. While the rise of fascism in Europe drove some
          precipitation of knowledge into the US in the 1930s and 1940s, the
          intellectual dominance that followed in the decades since the world wars
          was driven by a positive feedback loop which made the US increasingly
          attractive to the best minds of the world.</p>
        <p>The groundswells of industry established around major universities as
          well as billions of dollars of research funding c/o the NSF, NIH, and
          DARPA created prolific centers of intellectual activity. The Immigration
          and Nationality Act of 1965 opened the floodgates that were arguably
          already open to international students and skilled labor from all over
          the world. Out of all this emerged ecosystems of collaboration with
          regional specializations.</p>
        <p>These ecosystems built between industry and academia are the US’s
          intellectual catchment areas.</p>
        <p>The ongoing threats against these elite universities at the centers
          of intellectual catchment areas and the ongoing threats against
          immigration will undo what took a century to build.</p>
