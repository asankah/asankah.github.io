          in the US are struggling to deal with threats and funding cuts from
          the Trump administration.
        </p>
        <p>
          A major impact of funding cuts is the loss of enrollments of promising
          students due to fewer programs. International students now face an
          even more uncertain future where they may not be able to enroll at all
          despite being accepted
          <span class="citation" data-cites="harvardGazette1"
            ><a href="#ref-harvardGazette1" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span

            ><a href="#ref-massLive1" role="doc-biblioref">[5]</a></span
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, funding cuts have resulted in universities having to
          freeze academic programs or renege on accepted students
          <span class="citation" data-cites="bestColleges1"
            ><a href="#ref-bestColleges1" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a></span
          >, jeopardizing ongoing research programs. Also as a side-effect,
          promising academics both in the US and abroad are looking towards
          universities outside of the US
          <span class="citation" data-cites="npr1"

          Let’s have a look at the role these academic institutions are playing
          in the US’s industrial dominance, and the long-term effects of

          <h3>Migrations of Intellectual Capital</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout history a number of events have contributed to the
            present distribution of intellectual capital. As of this writing
            (July of 2025) the intellectual capital – especially when it comes
            to information technology and biotech – is heavily concentrated in
            the east and west coasts of the United States.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use the interactive timeline below to explore important events in
            the migration of intellectual capital to and within the United
            States.

By granting federal lands to states to establish public colleges focused on 'agriculture and the Mechanic arts,' the acts spurred the creation of new intellectual centers across the country, particularly in the Midwest and West. This deliberately shifted the focus from the classical education of the East Coast to a more practical, democratized form of knowledge. The Second Morrill Act of 1890 furthered this distribution by mandating the creation of separate institutions for Black students in former Confederate states, leading to the establishment of numerous Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and fostering intellectual capital within African American communities in the South.",

Simultaneously, waves of European immigrants, including a significant number of inventors and scientists like Nikola Tesla, brought their intellectual capital to the U.S., contributing to burgeoning sectors like electricity and chemicals.

By abolishing the national origins quota system and creating a preference system for immigrants with specific skills and professions, the law opened the door to highly educated individuals from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This policy deliberately targeted skilled labor and professionals, resulting in a significant and sustained 'brain gain' that enhanced U.S. competitiveness in science and technology.

            A hydro-catchment area is a geographic region that collects
            rainwater and funnels it into the reservoir. These are natural
            formations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without the hydro-catchment area the reservoir will starve. The
            health, robustness, and vitality of the hydro-catchment area
            directly impact the long-term viability of its reservoir.

          <p>
            Just as a reservoir relies on its hydro-catchment area to replenish
            their water supply, intellectual endeavors are similarly dependent
            on “intellectual catchment areas” —-regions that gather and channel
            information, ideas, and people.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a hydro-catchment area’s health dictates the long-term viability
            of its reservoir; so does the richness and connectivity of an
            intellectual catchment area directly influence the vitality of
            intellectual pursuits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without these intellectual catchment areas, the wellspring of
            creativity and innovation for a particular field risks drying up.

          Over many decades, particularly starting towards the end of the second
          world war, the United States has became one of the largest reservoirs
          of intellectual capital<a
            href="#fn1"
            class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref1"
            role="doc-noteref"
            ><sup>1</sup></a
          >. While the rise of fascism in Europe drove some precipitation of
          knowledge into the US in the 1930s and 1940s
          <span class="citation" data-cites="lassig"
            ><a href="#ref-lassig" role="doc-biblioref">[8]</a></span
          >, the intellectual dominance that followed in the decades since the
          world wars was driven by a positive feedback loop which made the US
          increasingly attractive to the best minds of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The groundswells of industry established around major universities as
          well as billions of dollars of research funding from the NSF, NIH, and
          DARPA created prolific centers of intellectual activity. The
          Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 opened the floodgates that
          were arguably already partially open to international students and
          skilled labor from all over the world. Out of all this emerged
          ecosystems of collaboration with regional specializations.
        </p>
        <p>
          These ecosystems built between industry, government, and academia are
          collectively the US’s intellectual catchment areas. It took centuries
          to build what we have now.
        </p>
        <p>
          What’s more important than what it is, is how the system sustains
          itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the short answer is that it works because it was working before.
          We were in a positive feedback loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifically, the fact that the whole world thinks of the United
          States as the leader in technology means that all the best minds want
          to live and work in the United States. The fact that the conditions
          were favorable for skilled immigrants to study, live, and work in the
          United States so far means that this dream becomes a reality to
          millions of people.
        </p>
        <p>It’s not just skilled immigration.</p>
        <p>
          The universities need to continue fostering the thought and
          collaboration that breeds innovation. Until this year, this positive
          feedback loop has remained stable. But positive feedback loops can
          break – especially if one were to violate several of the reasons why
          the loop exists in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ongoing threats against these elite universities at the centers of
          intellectual catchment areas and the ongoing threats against
          immigration will undo what took a century to build.

                The US is not the <em>largest</em> reservoir of intellectual
                capital. That honor likely goes to China. However in a number of
                fields, the US is –or was until recently– the most prolific.<a

              Asking if someone is <em>&quot;Asian&quot;</em> in a question of
              ethnicity or demographics or pretty much any context is bad. There
              is no reasonable conclusion you can arrive at about a person based

              For a team to succeed, it needs the flexibility to self-organize,
              which can lead to some members taking on more work. To avoid
              burnout, these extra contributions must be rewarded. Good managers
              are key, as they must recognize individual efforts and their
              team-wide impact. Well-designed incentives foster collaboration
              and reward those who strengthen the team, while poor incentives
              cause employees to stick rigidly to their roles and let the team
              fail.
