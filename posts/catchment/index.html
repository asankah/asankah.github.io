          the Trump administration.
        </p>
        <p>
          A major impact of funding cuts is the loss of enrollments of promising
          students due to fewer programs. International students now face an
          even more uncertain future where they may not be able to enroll at all
          despite being accepted

        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, funding cuts have resulted in universities having to

          <h3>Migrations of Intellectual Capital</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout history a number of events have contributed to the
            present distribution of intellectual capital. As of this writing
            (July of 2025) the intellectual capital – especially when it comes
            to information technology and biotech – is heavily concentrated in
            the east and west coasts of the United States.
          </p>

            Use the interactive timeline below to explore important events in
            the migration of intellectual capital to and within the United
            States.

The founding of the nine colonial colleges, such as Harvard, Yale, and the College of Philadelphia, solidified these urban centers as the primary hubs of early American intellect, attracting scholars and students and creating an environment for the dissemination of new ideas.",

                      "The Morrill Acts were a pivotal federal policy that drove the westward and southern migration of intellectual capital. By granting federal lands to states to establish public colleges focused on 'agriculture and the Mechanic arts,' the acts spurred the creation of new intellectual centers across the country, particularly in the Midwest and West. This deliberately shifted the focus from the classical education of the East Coast to a more practical, democratized form of knowledge. The Second Morrill Act of 1890 furthered this distribution by mandating the creation of separate institutions for Black students in former Confederate states, leading to the establishment of numerous Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and fostering intellectual capital within African American communities in the South.",

The founding of institutions like the University of Chicago, with its German-style research focus, attracted scholars and established a high-level intellectual center away from the East Coast. Simultaneously, waves of European immigrants, including a significant number of inventors and scientists like Nikola Tesla, brought their intellectual capital to the U.S., contributing to burgeoning sectors like electricity and chemicals.

This included the aerospace boom in Southern California and the birth of Silicon Valley in Northern California, which became the global epicenter for electronics, semiconductors, and computing.

            A hydro-catchment area is a geographic region that collects
            rainwater and funnels it into the reservoir. These are natural
            formations.

          <p>
            Without the hydro-catchment area the reservoir will starve. The
            health, robustness, and vitality of the hydro-catchment area
            directly impact the long-term viability of its reservoir.

            Just as a reservoir relies on its hydro-catchment area to replenish
            their water supply, intellectual endeavors are similarly dependent
            on “intellectual catchment areas” —-regions that gather and channel
            information, ideas, and people.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a hydro-catchment area’s health dictates the long-term viability
            of its reservoir; so does the richness and connectivity of an
            intellectual catchment area directly influence the vitality of
            intellectual pursuits.

            Without these intellectual catchment areas, the wellspring of

          Over many decades, particularly starting towards the end of the second

          world wars was driven by a positive feedback loop which made the US
          increasingly attractive to the best minds of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The groundswells of industry established around major universities as
          well as billions of dollars of research funding from the NSF, NIH, and
          DARPA created prolific centers of intellectual activity. The
          Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 opened the floodgates that
          were arguably already partially open to international students and
          skilled labor from all over the world. Out of all this emerged
          ecosystems of collaboration with regional specializations.
        </p>
        <p>
          These ecosystems built between industry, government, and academia are
          collectively the US’s intellectual catchment areas. It took centuries
          to build what we have now.
        </p>
        <p>
          What’s more important than what it is, is how the system sustains
          itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the short answer is that it works because it was working before.
          We were in a positive feedback loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifically, the fact that the whole world thinks of the United
          States as the leader in technology means that all the best minds want
          to live and work in the United States. The fact that the conditions
          were favorable for skilled immigrants to study, live, and work in the
          United States so far means that this dream becomes a reality to
          millions of people.
        </p>
        <p>It’s not just skilled immigration.</p>
        <p>
          The universities need to continue fostering the thought and
          collaboration that breeds innovation. Until this year, this positive
          feedback loop has remained stable. But positive feedback loops can
          break – especially if one were to violate several of the reasons why
          the loop exists in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ongoing threats against these elite universities at the centers of
          intellectual catchment areas and the ongoing threats against
          immigration will undo what took a century to build.
