configuration UI. It looks like this:</p><figure><img src=./blank-ui.png alt="A UI mock where all the labels are text boxes, and the values are also text boxes. The button just “button”."><br><figcaption>Your new UX.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>You</strong>: What is this? Is this modern?</p><p><strong>UX</strong>: That’s be beauty of it. The user can type in the
label <em>and</em> type in the value.</p><p><strong>You</strong>: And how would they know what the labels are and
what valid values are?</p><p><strong>UX</strong>: We will write some documentation on what the
labels and values should be.</p><p><strong>You</strong>: What about validation?</p><p><strong>UX</strong>: Hmm. That would be nice. But the UI doesn’t
really know what the valid values are.</p><p><strong>You</strong>: Come again?</p><p><strong>UX</strong>: The UI is neutral. Again, the valid labels and
values are documented.</p><p><strong>You</strong>: Is it a good document?</p><p><strong>UX</strong>: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.</p><p><strong>You</strong>: Is it a single document?</p><p><strong>UX</strong>: We are thinking more along the line of leaning
into crowd sourcing. Like there will be some documentation, but really
the labels and values are consumed by the backend. We don’t really have
much control of that.</p><p><strong>You</strong>: So, the backend is responsible for keeping the
documentation up to date? How has that worked out before?</p><p><strong>UX</strong>: Not great.</p><p><strong>You</strong>: So, any good news here? Why are we doing
this?</p><p><strong>UX</strong>: Because it’s config-as-code. It’s the new
hotness.</p><p><strong>You</strong>: Say no more fam.</p><p>So here’s the thing. Config-as-code isn’t new. That’s how it was
before any GUIs existed. Anyone hows configured an old OS, and some new
ones, will tell you that the only way some parts can be configured is by
editing text files; sometimes using an esoteric editor called
<code>vi</code><a href=#fn1 class=footnote-ref id=fnref1 role=doc-noteref><sup>1</sup></a>.</p><p>Then there was a glorious age of GUIs. At some point they started
treating developers and sysadmins like real people. You might not
believe this, but they even did user experience testing to make sure
those sysadmins’ lives were as easy as possible. It was glorious.</p><p>And now, what’s old is new again.</p><h2 id=the-pros>The Pros</h2><p>There are in fact good reasons for config-as-code. Here’s a few:</p><ol type=1><li><p><strong>No more opaque configuration</strong>.</p><p>Fancy UIs often mean that the configuration data goes straight into
an opaque configuration store somewhere. Sure it will come around and
affect the behavior of whatever it was that is being configured. But
that stuff usually doesn’t involve the user.</p><p>Usually the the platform doesn’t have much reason to keep
configuration a secret. So there will be some schema and some method to
storing and querying the configuration.</p><p>However when it comes to third-party or hosted services, this is not
always the case. The how the configuration is stored and how it is
reified into behavior is opaque.</p><p>With configuration-as-code (Can I call this CaC? That’ll be more
convenient.) the user is in control of storage. How else would they
write it down? The schema must necessarily also be made available to the
user.</p></li><li><p><strong>All the controls of source code</strong>.</p><p>Anyone who’s written some source code and used some source control
tool will tell you how useful source control can be.</p><p>Almost trivially you get:</p><ol type=1><li><p><strong>History</strong> and all that comes with it like the
ability to revert back to known good states.</p></li><li><p><strong>Blame/Praise</strong> and attribution of changes to
specific authors – assuming there’s sufficient authentication and
authorization in place.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reviews/Approvals</strong> that verify that the changes
were correct and appropriate.</p></li></ol><p>Unless someone can be mandated to stand behind you and look over your
shoulder taking notes, none of that comes for free with a sysadmin at a
GUI.</p></li><li><p><strong>Audits, validation, automation</strong>.</p><p>Follows from the above. Now that the configuration is inspectable and
understandable, it is easily amenable to automation and validation.</p><p>One could argue that this was always the case. However, now the user
is empowered to do so with the same fidelity as the authors of the
system.</p></li></ol><h2 id=and-the-cons>And the cons</h2><p>The things that need <em>fixing</em> is usability.</p><p>We spent decades saying Fitt’s law this and “recognition over recall”
that, and then threw everything away. It’s time we put all that
experience into action.</p><p>Just because the configuration is in text files doesn’t mean that it
has to be authored that way. Even if it did, it is still possible to
substantially improve the UX there.</p><p>Why do people enjoy Mad Libs but wouldn’t enjoy writing the same
content from scratch? The answer is “recognition over recall”.</p><figure><img src=./madlibs.png alt="The original Mad Libs book gave this example: “___________! he said ________ as he jumped into his convertible ______ and drove off with his _________ wife.” exclamation adverb noun adjective."><br><figcaption>An example from the original Mad Libs book. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs>Source: Wikipedia</a></figcaption></figure><p>We can have the format and options documented somewhere and have the
user consult the document at every step of the way. This sound
reasonable at first. So people write things like “read all the
documentation carefully before attempting to configure the thing.”</p><p>But the amount of information that a human being can keep track of at
a given time is limited. What it ends up being is a tiresom sequence of
flipping back and forth between reference and implementation.</p><figure><img src=./reference-and-configuration-eyes.png alt="Attention shifts from the reference to the configuration being edited and back; repeatedly."><br><figcaption>Left to right to left to right …</figcaption></figure><h2 id=making-things-better>Making things better</h2><p>It turns out we already have some ideas on how to fix this, because
the same problems plague software engineering. Or I should say the other
areas of software engineering.</p><p>Here are several approaches I’ve seen in practice that make
config-as-code more bearable.</p><h3 id=language-serversautocomplete>Language Servers/Autocomplete</h3><p>Pretty much the only useful development in coding in the past several
decades is autocomplete. A good schema along with documentation can make
a huge difference. Try editing the VS Code settings file to see it in
action.</p><h3 id=templates>Templates</h3><p>As the Mad Libs example shows, templates are much easier and more
expedient than a blank empty document.</p><p>Other examples of templates include:</p><p>But templates in general only work the first time. So subsequent
edits to the configuration will have to contend without the help of a
template. This is a biggie since configurations can’t be updated when
updating their corresponding templates.</p><h3 id=alternate-uis>Alternate UIs</h3><p>We once used to have WYSIWYG UI editors. Now we have to write our UIs
as code in one of any number of frameworks that in turn try to reduce
the toil of writing UIs. It doesn’t have to be this way.</p><p>At least for configuration, just because the configuration is written
down as code doesn’t mean it has to be edited as code. The same UIs that
we once used can still generate those text files.</p><aside id=footnotes class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document" role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn1><p>Vim is actually quite awesome. <a href=https://neovim.io>Neovim</a> is slightly more or less awesome
