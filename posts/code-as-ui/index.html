        <p>
          Your UX person comes up to you with the new mocks for the
          configuration UI. It looks like this:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img

            alt="A UI mock where all the labels are text boxes, and the values are also text boxes. The button just “button”."

              /posts/code-as-ui/ktRaziYXSc-324.png 324w
            "
            sizes="auto"
          />
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">
            A UI mock where all the labels are text boxes, and the values are
            also text boxes. The button just “button”.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p><strong>You</strong>: What is this? Is this modern?</p>
        <p>
          <strong>UX</strong>: That’s be beauty of it. The user can type in the
          label <em>and</em> type in the value.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>You</strong>: And how would they know what the labels are and
          what valid values are?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>UX</strong>: We will write some documentation on what the
          labels and values should be.
        </p>
        <p><strong>You</strong>: What about validation?</p>
        <p>
          <strong>UX</strong>: Hmm. That would be nice. But the UI doesn’t
          really know what the valid values are.
        </p>
        <p><strong>You</strong>: Come again?</p>
        <p>
          <strong>UX</strong>: The UI is neutral. Again, the valid labels and
          values are documented.
        </p>
        <p><strong>You</strong>: Is it a good document?</p>
        <p><strong>UX</strong>: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.</p>
        <p><strong>You</strong>: Is it a single document?</p>
        <p>
          <strong>UX</strong>: We are thinking more along the line of leaning
          into crowd sourcing. Like there will be some documentation, but really
          the labels and values are consumed by the backend. We don’t really
          have much control of that.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>You</strong>: So, the backend is responsible for keeping the
          documentation up to date? How has that worked out before?
        </p>
        <p><strong>UX</strong>: Not great.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>You</strong>: So, any good news here? Why are we doing this?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>UX</strong>: Because it’s config-as-code. It’s the new
          hotness.
        </p>
        <p><strong>You</strong>: Say no more fam.</p>
        <p>
          So here’s the thing. Config-as-code isn’t new. That’s how it was
          before any GUIs existed. Anyone hows configured an old OS, and some
          new ones, will tell you that the only way some parts can be configured
          is by editing text files; sometimes using an esoteric editor called
          <code>vi</code
          ><a
            href="#fn1"
            class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref1"
            role="doc-noteref"
            interestfor="ref-1-preview"
            style="anchor-name: --ref-1-preview-anchor"
            ><sup>1</sup></a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there was a glorious age of GUIs. At some point they started
          treating developers and sysadmins like real people. You might not
          believe this, but they even did user experience testing to make sure
          those sysadmins’ lives were as easy as possible. It was glorious.
        </p>
        <p>And now, what’s old is new again.</p>
        <h2 id="the-pros">The Pros</h2>
        <p>There are in fact good reasons for config-as-code. Here’s a few:</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p><strong>No more opaque configuration</strong>.</p>
            <p>
              Fancy UIs often mean that the configuration data goes straight
              into an opaque configuration store somewhere. Sure it will come
              around and affect the behavior of whatever it was that is being
              configured. But that stuff usually doesn’t involve the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              Usually the the platform doesn’t have much reason to keep
              configuration a secret. So there will be some schema and some
              method to storing and querying the configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
              However when it comes to third-party or hosted services, this is
              not always the case. The how the configuration is stored and how
              it is reified into behavior is opaque.
            </p>
            <p>
              With configuration-as-code (Can I call this CaC? That’ll be more
              convenient.) the user is in control of storage. How else would
              they write it down? The schema must necessarily also be made
              available to the user.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>All the controls of source code</strong>.</p>
            <p>
              Anyone who’s written some source code and used some source control
              tool will tell you how useful source control can be.
            </p>
            <p>Almost trivially you get:</p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>History</strong> and all that comes with it like the
                  ability to revert back to known good states.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Blame/Praise</strong> and attribution of changes to
                  specific authors – assuming there’s sufficient authentication
                  and authorization in place.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Reviews/Approvals</strong> that verify that the
                  changes were correct and appropriate.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Unless someone can be mandated to stand behind you and look over
              your shoulder taking notes, none of that comes for free with a
              sysadmin at a GUI.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Audits, validation, automation</strong>.</p>
            <p>
              Follows from the above. Now that the configuration is inspectable
              and understandable, it is easily amenable to automation and
              validation.
            </p>
            <p>
              One could argue that this was always the case. However, now the
              user is empowered to do so with the same fidelity as the authors
              of the system.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="and-the-cons">And the cons</h2>
        <p>The things that need <em>fixing</em> is usability.</p>
        <p>
          We spent decades saying Fitt’s law this and “recognition over recall”
          that, and then threw everything away. It’s time we put all that
          experience into action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just because the configuration is in text files doesn’t mean that it
          has to be authored that way. Even if it did, it is still possible to
          substantially improve the UX there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why do people enjoy Mad Libs but wouldn’t enjoy writing the same
          content from scratch? The answer is “recognition over recall”.

          We can have the format and options documented somewhere and have the
          user consult the document at every step of the way. This sound
          reasonable at first. So people write things like “read all the
          documentation carefully before attempting to configure the thing.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But the amount of information that a human being can keep track of at
          a given time is limited. What it ends up being is a tiresom sequence
          of flipping back and forth between reference and implementation.

        <h2 id="making-things-better">Making things better</h2>
        <p>
          It turns out we already have some ideas on how to fix this, because
          the same problems plague software engineering. Or I should say the
          other areas of software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are several approaches I’ve seen in practice that make
          config-as-code more bearable.
        </p>
        <h3 id="language-serversautocomplete">Language Servers/Autocomplete</h3>
        <p>
          Pretty much the only useful development in coding in the past several
          decades is autocomplete. A good schema along with documentation can
          make a huge difference. Try editing the VS Code settings file to see
          it in action.
        </p>
        <h3 id="templates">Templates</h3>
        <p>
          As the Mad Libs example shows, templates are much easier and more
          expedient than a blank empty document.
        </p>
        <p>Other examples of templates include:</p>
        <p>
          But templates in general only work the first time. So subsequent edits
          to the configuration will have to contend without the help of a
          template. This is a biggie since configurations can’t be updated when
          updating their corresponding templates.
        </p>
        <h3 id="alternate-uis">Alternate UIs</h3>
        <p>
          We once used to have WYSIWYG UI editors. Now we have to write our UIs
          as code in one of any number of frameworks that in turn try to reduce
          the toil of writing UIs. It doesn’t have to be this way.
        </p>
        <p>
          At least for configuration, just because the configuration is written
          down as code doesn’t mean it has to be edited as code. The same UIs
          that we once used can still generate those text files.
        </p>

                  A recent study found that more gender-equal countries have
                  larger gender gaps in mental health. I look at the data that
                  seems to have yielded this counter-intuitive results and find
                  it lacking.

                  For a team to succeed, it needs the flexibility to
                  self-organize, which can lead to some members taking on more
                  work. To avoid burnout, these extra contributions must be
                  rewarded. Good managers are key, as they must recognize
                  individual efforts and their team-wide impact. Well-designed
                  incentives foster collaboration and reward those who
                  strengthen the team, while poor incentives cause employees to
                  stick rigidly to their roles and let the team fail.

                  Line-length and line-spacing slightly affect the ergonomics of
                  reading on the web, but not significantly. However, evidence
                  suggests that adults prefer &quot;medium&quot; length columns
                  of text.
