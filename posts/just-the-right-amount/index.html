        <p>Zero technical debt sounds like a great target to aim for. In my
          earlier developer days I strongly believed that all projects should go
          for this target. At a company all-hands I heard from a senior engineer
          that having zero technical debt is often not what we want. I felt
          betrayed.</p>
        <p>Why is it that zero technical debt isn’t what we want?</p>
        <h2 id="memory-allocation-strategy-leak-all-allocations">Memory
          Allocation Strategy: Leak All Allocations</h2>
        <p>Let’s take a moment and think of a hypothetical program. If you knew
          that your program ran once and terminated, would you go through the
          effort of deallocating each individual memory allocation at the end? You
          are about to end the process and drop the entire heap anyway. Cleaning
          the heap at this point is a waste. For short-lived programs who’s memory
          consumption is bounded and less than the available memory the more
          efficient strategy is to just leak all memory.</p>
        <p>One might wonder if such a strategy would break reusability. “Leak
          all allocations” doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t call
          <code>free()</code> (or equivalent) in your code. It means that the
          memory manager would treat <code>free()</code> as a no-op. This
          principal also applies to garbage collected languages. After all, the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20100809-00/?p=13203#:~:text=Garbage%20collection%20is%20simulating%20a%20computer%20with%20an%20infinite%20amount%20of%20memory."><em>job
of memory management is to simulate infinite memory</em></a>. If you are
          only going to use a finite amount of memory then you don’t need memory
          management.

          Enough Technical Debt Look Like?</h2>
        <p>Some of the motivation for stopping short of perfect comes from the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">Mythical
            Man Month</a>.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>For the human makers of things, the incompletenesses and
            inconsistencies of our ideas become clear only during implementation.
            Thus it is that writing, experimentation, “working out” are essential
            disciplines for the theoretician.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>The hardest part of the software task is arriving at a complete and
            consistent specification, and much of the essence of building a program
            is in fact the debugging of the specification.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>Software projects tend to be characteristically similar. Putting too
          much effort into a project features you don’t need and polishing up code
          that nobody will reuse is wasteful. It’s just a little bit harder to
          know when you’ve crossed the point of diminishing returns where cleaning
          up the code no longer makes sense.</p>
