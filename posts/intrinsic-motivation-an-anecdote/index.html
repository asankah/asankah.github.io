        <p>A long long time ago in a totally hypothetical company that still
          exists but only in name, there was a little bit of discontent<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. You see, one of the core values of
          the company was its commitment to diversity and inclusion. Rather than
          lowering the bar, like how some people think inclusion works, they had
          many outreach programs that encouraged women and minorities to take up
          STEM. These outreach programs almost necessarily fell on the shoulders
          of the women and minorities who were already employed at the company –
          after all representation matters. Those who worked on these did so out
          of their own passion. They wanted to help others like them.</p>
        <p>Anyone who has worked in tech will tell you it’s a lot of work. This
          company’s performance review system attempted to measure the amount and
          quality of said work so that they can reward the right people for the
          right reasons. Since the company deemed that having a diverse workforce
          was in their best interest, ideally they would reward people working
          towards that goal. However, the performance review system didn’t measure
          anything about volunteer work like what the people doing outreach were
          doing.</p>
        <p>So those volunteers were unhappy. All that extra work, often done at
          the expense of work that <em>is</em> measured in the performance review
          system, didn’t count for anything when career progress was concerned.
          They wanted change.</p>
        <p>The company listened.</p>
        <p><em>“Community contributions”</em> got added to the job descriptions
          for people at all levels. Naturally the higher the level, the broader in
          scope those contributions were required to be. It was now part of
          everyone’s job to make contributions that made the company’s culture
          better – be it recruitment, outreach, or whatever.</p>
        <p>The changes to the performance review system was an improvement. But
          unintentionally it had other side-effects. Notably, those higher up the
          organizational ladder found that their community contributions need to
          be commesurate with their status. But starting up an effort that is at
          the company or region level was a lot of work. Lucky for them, those
          volunteers who were passionate about helping others had already
          established programs that were of the right scale.</p>
        <p>So as career focused people are wont to do, they threw their weight
          around and effectively took over these outreach programs. The volunteers
          were upset. Some left. Others kept working but at a smaller capacity
          than what they were before. The career focused people were happy, but
          the volunteers were not.</p>
        <p>The outreach programs still existed<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> but
          were run by people who were no longer doing it just to help other
          people. They were run by people who were trying to help themselves. The
          programs faltered; quality went down; the effectiveness of the programs
          went downhill. It wasn’t fun or rewarding as it was before.</p>
