          A long long time ago in a totally hypothetical company that still
          exists but only in name, there was a little bit of discontent<sup
            class="footnote-ref"
            ><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup
          >. You see, one of the core values of the company was its commitment
          to diversity and inclusion. Rather than lowering the bar, like how
          some people think inclusion works, they had many outreach programs
          that encouraged women and minorities to take up STEM. These outreach
          programs almost necessarily fell on the shoulders of the women and
          minorities who were already employed at the company – after all
          representation matters. Those who worked on these did so out of their
          own passion. They wanted to help others like them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyone who has worked in tech will tell you it’s a lot of work. This
          company’s performance review system attempted to measure the amount
          and quality of said work so that they can reward the right people for
          the right reasons. Since the company deemed that having a diverse
          workforce was in their best interest, ideally they would reward people
          working towards that goal. However, the performance review system
          didn’t measure anything about volunteer work like what the people
          doing outreach were doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          So those volunteers were unhappy. All that extra work, often done at
          the expense of work that <em>is</em> measured in the performance
          review system, didn’t count for anything when career progress was
          concerned. They wanted change.
        </p>
        <p>The company listened.</p>
        <p>
          <em>“Community contributions”</em> got added to the job descriptions
          for people at all levels. Naturally the higher the level, the broader
          in scope those contributions were required to be. It was now part of
          everyone’s job to make contributions that made the company’s culture
          better – be it recruitment, outreach, or whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
          The changes to the performance review system was an improvement. But
          unintentionally it had other side-effects. Notably, those higher up
          the organizational ladder found that their community contributions
          need to be commesurate with their status. But starting up an effort
          that is at the company or region level was a lot of work. Lucky for
          them, those volunteers who were passionate about helping others had
          already established programs that were of the right scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          So as career focused people are wont to do, they threw their weight
          around and effectively took over these outreach programs. The
          volunteers were upset. Some left. Others kept working but at a smaller
          capacity than what they were before. The career focused people were
          happy, but the volunteers were not.
        </p>
        <p>
          The outreach programs still existed<sup class="footnote-ref"
            ><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup
          >
          but were run by people who were no longer doing it just to help other
          people. They were run by people who were trying to help themselves.
          The programs faltered; quality went down; the effectiveness of the
          programs went downhill. It wasn’t fun or rewarding as it was before.

                For a team to succeed, it needs the flexibility to
                self-organize, which can lead to some members taking on more
                work. To avoid burnout, these extra contributions must be
                rewarded. Good managers are key, as they must recognize
                individual efforts and their team-wide impact. Well-designed
                incentives foster collaboration and reward those who strengthen
                the team, while poor incentives cause employees to stick rigidly
                to their roles and let the team fail.
