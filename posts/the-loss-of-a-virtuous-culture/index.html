        <p>Long ago, around 2011, we had an espresso machine in the Google micro
          kitchen – or MK as we called it – near my desk. There were no baristas
          at the time, so people made their own. Some folks thought we could use
          more sophisticated coffee beans than they had in the MK. A designated
          person would purchase these higher-quality beans using money that
          everyone collected in a jar in the MK.</p>
        <p>This cash jar was not locked. Instead, it was in a conspicuous
          location, along with a note suggesting that people using the “good”
          beans should consider dropping some cash there so that people could
          continue purchasing premium beans.</p>
        <p>One day, the cash in the jar went missing.</p>
        <p>The response was swift. Donations poured from everywhere in the
          office, offering to replace the lost cash. Noone speculated on who took
          the money. Things were back to normal as soon as the incident was
          reported. The cash jar was re-instated.</p>
        <p>The cynic in me wondered why the money didn’t get stolen sooner. But
          everything worked on the honor system at Google. And we were insistent
          on keeping it that way.</p>
        <p>As far as I know, the money never went missing again, though the cash
          jar system went away as folks moved around inside the ever-expanding
          office.</p>
        <p>Cash isn’t used as much anymore. However, would a similar system work
          now? We no longer place as much trust in each other as we did. We don’t
          even know most of the people we see walking around. But something is
          going on beyond that. Even if we did know the people, we are now more
          attuned to insider risk – and justifiably so. As a result, there is more
          of an air of distrust.</p>
        <p>What would be the consequences of a breakdown in mutual trust among
          employees? In <a href="https://brianlui.dog/2020/10/06/upside-decay/">“Upside Decay,”</a>
          Brian Lui argues that such a breakdown in virtue limits an
          organization’s ability to benefit from luck.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="virtuous-cycle.png" alt="How a culture of virtue increases the likelihood of collaboration outside of their core work.">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">How a culture of virtue increases the
            likelihood of collaboration outside of their core work.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>As the diagram indicates, a virtuous culture cultivates
          collaboration, leading to successful extra-curricular activity beyond
          their core work, which reinforces the culture. Notably, many of Google’s
          successful billion-dollar products came about or benefited from
          unexpected collaborations that were more or less luck. In a culture of
          mistrust, such associations outside of their core work would never have
          happened.</p>
        <p>Leadership can identify, plan, and account for some contingencies in
          core work. Non-core work, on the other hand, relies on self organization
          within the company. That self organization needs trust. Every large
          project owes its existence to this non-core work.</p>
        <p>And that’s not all. Some of this work may well become large products
          in their own right. Any large tech company will have tons of stories of
          this happening repeatedly.</p>
        <p>The importance of “serendipitous collaboration” isn’t lost on
          executives. It is the reason behind many pushes for bringing tech
          workers back to the office.</p>

            <p>Large projects accumulate a large number of issue reports over time. This
              is normal. Typically for a &quot;successful&quot; project the rate of new issues
              being reported will exceed the rate of issues being fixed. Hence the
              growth.</p>
