            This article is an attempt to explain the concept of buffer bloat to
            someone not super familiar with networking. Why would someone not
            super familiar with networking need to know about buffer bloat? It
            was supposed to point out the effects of trying to <em>hide</em> or
            <em>delay</em> negative feedback loops.

            Devices on the internet including your phone, laptop, gaming
            console, refridgerator, etc. communicate by exchanging data
            <em>“packets”</em>. They are of course not physical packets. It’s
            just a useful way to describe a unit of data sent over a wire or
            some other network connection. A packet could be thought of as, say,
            a single frame in a video or a small slice of audio, or a couple of
            paragraphs of text in a webpage. Devices on the internet will take a
            big chunk of data (e.g. a video clip) and break it down into smaller
            pieces (e.g. a single frame in the video clip) and then sends each
            of these pieces along the network. The receiving device puts the
            pieces back together to reconstruct the original thing (e.g. the
            video clip again)<a

        <p>
          Each packet has little pieces of extra information to help it get to
          where it needs to go. One piece is where it comes from (a source
          <em>“address”</em>). Another is where it is going (a target
          <em>“address”</em>). Devices along the network (like your internet
          provider’s networking equipment, satellites, etc.) use this extra
          information to correctly route the packets to their intended
          destination.
        </p>
        <p>
          The network is large and constantly changing. So each device focuses
          only on getting the packet at least one step closer to its
          destination. The specific journey taken by a packet is unkonwn until
          it is on its way.

        <p>
          So let’s say a video streaming service wants to send your mobile phone
          a video. First the streaming service breaks up the video into small
          packets. Then it throws all the packets into the network so that the
          network can deliver them to your phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the streaming service pushes data out at exactly the
          <em>right</em> speed and the network doesn’t break, then everything
          works out great. All the packets make it to the destination without
          hassle. But neither the streaming service nor your phone know what
          that <em>right</em> speed is due to the aforementioned unknowability
          of the network.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sending too much data can overwhelm some devices or connections in the
          network. If a device gets more data than it can handle, it’s likely
          that it will start dropping packets until it can catch up.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="/posts/buffer-bloat/3ZQ9haPR4u-757.png"

        <p>
          Sending too little data isn’t great either. The speed might be too
          slow for streaming video. The receiving device will underperform.
          Users will be confused why their expensive broadband connection
          doesn’t let them watch streaming video.
        </p>
        <p>So how does the device know how much data to send out?</p>
        <h2 id="flow-control">Flow Control</h2>
        <p>
          The mechanisms we use to regulate the flow of data is called
          <em>“flow control.”</em> We are going to look at a method based on
          coordination between the sender and the receiver because
          <em
            >they are the only two actors in this scenario that we consider to
            be reliable and stable</em
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Different packets can take different paths See the network connections
          between <code>C-D</code> and <code>C-E</code> in the diagram above.
          Either of these paths can take a packet from <code>C</code> to
          <code>F</code>. Packets going down different paths will arrive at
          different times. Also, if the network gets overwhelmed or breaks, then
          some of the packets may not make it at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reciever needs to know how to put the packets back in order and
          tell if any are missing.
        </p>
        <p>
          To keep track of which packet is which, we can add some new
          information to the data packet: let’s call this the <em>sequence</em>.
          As you might imagine, the sequence can start at 1 and count each
          packet until the transmission is over. Each packet now has a unique
          position in the list of packets.
        </p>

        <p>
          Great. But how do we know which packets made it to the other side? The
          recipient will need to let us know this information in some sort of
          reply. This reply is <em>also</em> a data packet called an
          <em>acknowledgement</em>. It’s sent from the original recipient back
          to the sender.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ok so now we have all the information we need to perform some flow
          control.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can now figure out the optimal rate of data transfer experimentally
          using some method like this:
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Send data as fast as possible.</li>
          <li>
            If the recipient claims some packets were missing, then resend those
            packets and send packets <strong>slower</strong> than before.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the recipient hasn’t complained of missing packets in a while,
            try sending them <strong>faster</strong>.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="stuck-on-the-wire">Stuck On The Wire</h2>
        <p>
          Now imagine you sending data out - a rate of 100 packets per second.
          And let’s say it takes one second for a packet to get to the other
          side. Just before the end of the first second, the destination hasn’t
          received the first packet yet. But the sender has sent 100 packets.
        </p>
        <p>Where are the packets?</p>
        <p>
          We call this <em>“data on the wire’</em>. Some data is indeed on the
          wire literally, but that tends to be a tiny amount. Most of the data
          on the wire is actually at each of the devices along the way either
          being received, or waiting to be sent.
        </p>
        <p>
          So once we factor in the equipment in the middle, your path to the
          destination looks a little like this:
        </p>
        <p>
          The device sees some data come in, stores it, figures out where to
          send it next, and sends it on its way. There could be other stuff
          these boxes could be doing, but that’s something for another post.
        </p>
        <p>
          So from the perspective of a single box the world looks a bit like
          this:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="/posts/buffer-bloat/yl43sOc497-877.png"
            alt="The source has sent a bunch of packets. For a moment in time all the packets are either being transmitted somewhere or are waiting to be transmitted out of some device on the internet."
            width="877"
            height="406"
          />
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          If this is the limit for the network and the sender keeps sending more
          packets, then there’s no room for the packet. So it gets
          <em>“dropped”</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is common for a device to be at the border of a “good” network and
          a “not”good” network. The goodness here is the amount of data that can
          be stuffed into it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a burst of data comes along, not much data can be stuffed into
          the small pipe before no more can fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          As mentioned before, this means that the sender will need to
          <em>re-send</em> the dropped packets and also slow down the rate of
          data. Given enough time the rate of data transfer will approach the
          throughput of the smallest pipe along the way.
        </p>
        <h2 id="buffer-bloat">Buffer Bloat</h2>
        <p>
          Some folks looked at this setup and decided to improve things. There
          are some valid reasons for doing what they did – which is why so many
          people did this. But it didn’t quite have the intended effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what was the thing they did? They added
          <strong>buffering</strong>. Too much of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <em>buffer</em> is a resevoir where excess packets can be kept until
          the next link in the network is ready to accept more. What this means
          is that every device along the way is trying to do flow control by
          storing and resending packets instead of letting the sender know that
          packets are getting dropped.
        </p>

        <p>
          As before, let’s say the sender is sending 200 packets every second.
          The network still can only transfer 100. The excess packets – another
          100 of them – gets tossed into the buffer.

          Bob is the last packet in the buffer and must wait for all the other
          packets in the buffer to be send before it will get queued to sent
          out.
        </p>
        <p>
          In another second, the first 100 packets make it to the target, and
          now the 100 packets that were in the buffer are back on the wire.

          Once back on the network it will take another second for Bob to reach

        <p>
          Even under ideal conditions eventually the system settles on a new
          equilibrium with one difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          The length of time it takes for the data packets to make their way to
          the destination is much larger. Packets accumulate in buffers along
          the network. Each buffer adds an additional delay for the packet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall the throughput of the network is the same. But latency – the
          time it takes for a packet to get to the destination – is much larger.
        </p>
        <p>
          The effect is even worse in practice because this setup resists any
          attempt at flow control. It delays the discovery of actual throughput.
        </p>
        <p>This phenomenon is called <strong>buffer bloat</strong>.</p>

                  Any ephemeral low-entropy web observable property whose
                  changes are concurrently observable by multiple sites can lead
                  to cross site identity joining.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This method of identity joining does not require coordination
                  between multiple first parties. A single third party embedded
                  within multiple first parties can also use this method.
