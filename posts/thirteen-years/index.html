        <p>And just like that, another year sped by. It’s now been thirteen
          years since I joined Google.</p>
        <p>Of the people who started at Google that day just a hair over 50% are
          still at Google. Glancing through the list<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I
          see a couple of folks who have left for greener pastures or pursuing
          something on their own. Others who are still here have made their way up
          the organizational ladders.</p>
        <p>But for everyone on that list the Google of today is not the Google
          we joined all those years ago. Someone who had been at Google much
          longer than I have <a href="https://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1700627373&amp;count=1" title="Ian Hixie&#39;s blog: Reflecting on 18 years at Google">recently
            published their thoughts</a> after they left Google. They had good
          things to say about Google, but they also had some pretty harsh things
          to say. I can’t comment about some of the specifics they mentioned but
          the general sentiment checks out.</p>
        <p>Avery Pennarun<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> wrote a post that I think touches on
          something relevant and important. The post is called <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20190926" title="What do executives do anyway?">What do executives do anyway?</a>.
          To save you a read (though you really should add it to your <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/7343019?hl=en" title="Read pages later &amp; offline">reading list</a>), the salient
          points are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An executive’s <strong><em>only</em></strong> job is to <em>“enforce
<strong>culture and values</strong> for their whole
organization.”</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
          <li>The executives set and enforce the values. The rest of the company
            comes up with strategies accordingly.</li>
          <li><em>“In a large organization, executives don’t set strategy.”</em> …
            <em>“It’s an illusion to believe you can enforce a strategy.”</em>
          </li>
          <li>Useful organizational values involve real tradeoffs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>People have a common misconception that all employees of big
          companies are constantly thinking of the bottom line. This is not the
          case. Precious few teams can draw a clear line from their day-to-day
          work to any measurable change in the company’s performance<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. So
          at an individual level, decisions are influenced by concerns much closer
          to themselves: things like base pay, career, admiration of their peers,
          and their own sense of accomplishment.</p>
        <p>There are many things that an individual can work on to satisfy their
          immediate concerns. The <em>culture and values</em> of a company help
          narrow these options down to those that benefit everyone.</p>
        <p>The reason I brought up the topic of culture and values is because
          Google has a vacuum where an inspiring vision once was. Layoffs wreaked
          havoc with the trust that people had for each other and themselves. We
          are still <em>trying</em> to <a href="https://about.google/philosophy/" title="Ten things we know to be true">focus on the user</a>; <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/january-update/#:~:text=important%20moments%20to-,sharpen%20our%20focus,-%2C%20reengineer%20our%20cost" title="A difficult decision to set us up for the future">sharply, in
            fact</a>. But it is evident that company and its people are increasingly
          acting out of self preservation,</p>
