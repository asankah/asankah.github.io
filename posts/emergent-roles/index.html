        <p>Google’s early success is partly attributed to the use of commodity
          hardware instead of purpose built “super” computers as was the custom at
          the time. Rather than demanding perfection from complex systems it is
          far more effective to accept the imperfections and design with it <span class="citation" data-cites="srebookChap2"><a href="#ref-srebookChap2" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span>.</p>
        <p>Team roles are neither comprehensive nor precise; because nobody
          understands human roles so perfectly. In any given team structure,
          people are expected to adapt to a broad range of situations that are
          unpredictable, and frankly unknown. Some (most?) of those situations are
          directly due to other team members.</p>
        <p>As teams mature, the <em>actual</em> role each person takes on will
          gradually anneal around individual strengths and weaknesses. So in
          reality, what is intended to be a neat and well circumscribed role
          profile becomes irregular, undefined, and dynamic.</p>
        <p>Following the spirit of designing with imperfections, team
          organization must always account for this fluidity of roles.</p>

        <p>In short:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Roles in a team will rarely be circumscribed by the corresponding
            job description. You will wind up doing work outside your scope.</li>
          <li>Roles will overlap in ways that will run counter to the intents of
            the official role allocations. You will do other people’s work
            occasionally and vice versa.</li>
          <li><em>Roles will emerge that are not mentioned in anyone’s job
description.</em>. Sometimes called <em><em>soft</em></em> roles.</li>
        </ul>
        <section id="incentivizing-soft-roles" class="sidenote-host-1">
          <h3>Incentivizing Soft Roles</h3>
          <p>Leaders must set in place the right set of incentives for people to
            fill these soft roles when necessary. If people ridigly perform just
            their roles and let things fail around them (<em>“it’s not my job”</em>)
            that’s a sign of a bad incentive structure.</p>
          <p>The right incentives can only be put in place by leadership that is
            aware of their own limitations and acknowledge their own imperfections.
            That’s because those incentives need to leave enough room for others to
            compensate. In other words, the only system that can reasonably create
            the right incentives is one where the at least some authority of
            deciding compensation is laid in the hands of those who observe work
            directly.</p>
          <p>See <a href="/posts/intrinsic-motivation-an-anecdote/">Intrinsic and
              Extrinsic Motivation: An Anecdote</a> for an example of what happens
            when people try to force this process purely by creating extrinsic
            incentives and assigned roles.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="no-heros" class="sidenote-1">
          <h4>No Heros</h4>
          <p>Any organization whose success depends on their employees working
            <em>against</em> their own self interests will eventually fail.
          </p>
          <p>Unfortunately incentives are seldom constructed by people who
            understand what organizational cross beams are necessary to keep the
            <em>“official”</em> role hierarchy from collapsing. Leadership rarely
            hear you work till 2am, but they will hear the failure of their
            leadership eventually … and until then they will neither understand nor
            act.

              Heroism Is Bad</a> in the Google SRE site.</p>

        <h3 id="soft-roles-as-organizational-cross-beams">Soft Roles as
          Organizational Cross Beams</h3>
        <p>Beyond the obvious team scoped function of soft roles, they also
          perform important functions at the organizational level. Of these two
          common types are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Glue-people</strong> who are necessary to tie teams
              together, build cohesion, connect the dots between silos that are not
              effectively communicating with each other, and establish an unofficial
              foundation of trust that prevent teams from collapsing when the trust
              between leadership and workers inevitably crumbles.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Immune Systems</strong> are the people necessary to stop
              the company from shooting themselves in their corporate feet. These are
              the people who internally oppose measures that would cause widespread
              collapse of user-trust, violate privacy policies, open up the
              organization to litigation, irreversibly misuse customer data,
              unnecessarily jeopardize the operational stability or security of
              critical systems, or commit war crimes and human rights
              violations.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these categories deserve its own post. Stay tuned!</p>
