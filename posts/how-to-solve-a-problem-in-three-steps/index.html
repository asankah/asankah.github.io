stupid jokes to a brand new audience.</p><p>Here’s one:</p><div class=quotable><p>How do you put an elephant in a refridgerator in three steps?</p><ol type=1><li>Open the door.</li><li>Put elephant in the refridgerator.</li><li>Close the door.</li></ol></div><p>It’s funny becuase the purported “answer” doesn’t address any of the
important questions raised by the initial question; not the least of
which regards the mismatch in geometry between a <em>normal</em>
refridgerator (a household one that immediately springs to the minds of
the audience) and the average live elephant. It’s funny to us becuase we
are familiar with both of these concepts enough to immediately see the
problem. So we immediately prioritize the critical concerns.</p><p>We all get it. But then we are somehow completely blind to the fact
that …</p><div class=quotable><p>… <strong>this is what our OKRs look like after a planning
sprint.</strong></p></div><p>At Google, as it is with many other large and aging tech companies,
planning of this sort happens in middle management.</p><p>The requisite attributes for doing long arc planning are …</p><div class=quotable><p>… <strong>authority, domain expertise, and ability to
strategize</strong>. Choose (at most) two.</p></div><figure><img src=./triangle-of-doom.png alt="Authority, domain expertise, and ability to plan: Choose (at most) two."><figcaption aria-hidden=true>Authority, domain expertise, and ability
to plan: Choose (at most) two.</figcaption></figure><ol type=1><li><strong>Domain expertise</strong> concerns the understanding of the
problem area that is being tackled.</li><li><strong>Ability to plan</strong> (or strategize) covers not just
having a vision, but also enough understanding of the tools that are
available to derive a set of strategies that will achieve a desirable
goal.</li><li><strong>Authority</strong> is the propety of being in the right
place in the organizational hierarchy to exert control over a group of
people who are capable of executing on the strategies. I.e. being in
management at the right level.</li></ol><p>In tech, people get to management either by being promoted out of
their zone of competence or by bullshitting their way up the management
chain. Hence the distribution of the <em>authority</em> attribute
doesn’t necessarily correlate with either of the other two attributes<a href=#fn1 class=footnote-ref id=fnref1 role=doc-noteref><sup>1</sup></a>.</p><p>So you end up with a layer of middle management that share the
<em>authority</em> attribute, but at most one of the other two<a href=#fn2 class=footnote-ref id=fnref2 role=doc-noteref><sup>2</sup></a>.</p><p>But in most cases “planning sprint” is code for “prepare for damage
control” for those who have <em>domain expertise</em> and <em>ability to
plan</em> attributes but not the <em>authority</em> attribute.</p><p>When people who understand neither refridgerators or elephants decide
to solve problems, the outcome usually looks like the joke we mentioned
before; but with the added injury of unrealistic timelines.</p><div class=quotable><p>Worse, when the strategies are spelled out without understanding the
problem or the purpose of a strategy, the outcome is that those those
doing the work <strong>must frame their work in terms of putting
something into a refridgerator in three steps</strong>.</p></div><p>This process is extra fun when the planners have decided to put not
one but <strong>two</strong> things in the refridgerator without being
specific about what they are. We know one of those things <em>must</em>
be an elephant for the long term viability of the product, but the other
one could be an orange for all we care. So the workers now have to frame
<em>“solving the elephant”</em> in terms of <em>“putting the elephant in
the refridgerator”</em>.</p><p>But the middle management layer continues to consider the orange and
the elephant as being roughly equal problems. Hence <a href=https://www.warp.dev/blog/problems-with-promotion-oriented-cultures>those
who play the ladder game</a> know to work on the orange and not touch
the elephant.</p><p>It is surprising how few good decisions need to be made in order to
keep a multi-billion dollar enterprise chugging along – at least as far
as investors are concerned. You should begin to understand why a company
with so many smart people and so many brilliant creations can make so
many self-defeating mistakes.</p><p>What is not suprising is the amount of fat that constitutes the
middle management of these companies. The <a href=https://brucefwebster.com/2008/04/15/the-wetware-crisis-the-themocline-of-truth/>thermocline
of truth</a> ensures that those looking down from the top will never see
the fat for what it is.</p><aside id=footnotes class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document" role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn1><p>I can attest to the fact that there are people who only
have the <em>authority</em> attribute. It is a thing.<a href=#fnref1 class=footnote-back role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a></p></li><li id=fn2><p>Rarely someone will get to a place where they have all
the attributes combined. When this happens it is glorious. You can tell
when such people are in charge even without knowing who the people are.
In these organizations, you will find sensible decisions being made,
people working under realistic timelines, and towards goals that are
clearly achievable through the strategies that they are executing upon.
It is truly a joy to work in such an organization.<a href=#fnref2 class=footnote-back role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a></p></li></ol></aside></div><div class=pagination><a href=/posts/asians-is-not-a-useful-category/ class="left arrow">&#8592;</a>
