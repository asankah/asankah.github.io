          One fun thing with having kids is that you get to repeat all the old
          stupid jokes to a brand new audience.
        </p>
        <p>Here’s one:</p>
        <figure>
          <p>How do you put an elephant in a refridgerator in three steps?</p>
          <figcaption>
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Open the door.</li>
              <li>Put elephant in the refridgerator.</li>
              <li>Close the door.</li>
            </ol>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          It’s funny because the purported “answer” doesn’t address any of the
          important questions raised by the initial question; not the least of
          which regards the mismatch in geometry between a
          <em>normal</em> refridgerator (a household one that immediately
          springs to the minds of the audience) and the average live elephant.
          It’s funny to us becuase we are familiar with both of these concepts
          enough to immediately see the problem. So we immediately prioritize
          the critical concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          We all get it. But then we are somehow completely blind to the fact
          that …
        </p>
        <div class="quotable">
          <p>
            …
            <strong
              >this is what our OKRs look like after a planning sprint.</strong
            >
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          At Google, as it is with many other large and aging tech companies,
          planning of this sort happens in middle management.
        </p>
        <p>The requisite attributes for doing long arc planning are …</p>
        <div class="quotable">
          <p>
            …
            <strong
              >authority, domain expertise, and ability to strategize</strong
            >. Choose (at most) two.

            alt="Authority, domain expertise, and ability to plan: Choose (at most) two."
            width="447"
            height="300"
          />
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">
            Authority, domain expertise, and ability to plan: Choose (at most)
            two.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <strong>Domain expertise</strong> concerns the understanding of the
            problem area that is being tackled.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ability to plan</strong> (or strategize) covers not just
            having a vision, but also enough understanding of the tools that are
            available to derive a set of strategies that will achieve a
            desirable goal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Authority</strong> is the propety of being in the right
            place in the organizational hierarchy to exert control over a group
            of people who are capable of executing on the strategies. I.e. being
            in management at the right level.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In tech, people get to management either by being promoted out of
          their zone of competence or by bullshitting their way up the
          management chain. Hence the distribution of the
          <em>authority</em> attribute doesn’t necessarily correlate with either
          of the other two attributes<a
            href="#fn1"
            class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref1"
            role="doc-noteref"
            interestfor="fnref1-preview"
            style="anchor-name: --fnref1-anchor"
            data-anchor-name="--fnref1-anchor"
            ><sup>1</sup></a
          >.
        </p>
        <div class="sidenote-host-1">
          <p>
            So you end up with a layer of middle management that share the
            <em>authority</em> attribute, but at most one of the other two.
          </p>
        </div>
        <aside class="sidenote-1">
          <p>
            Rarely someone will get to a place where they have all the
            attributes combined. When this happens it is glorious. You can tell
            when such people are in charge even without knowing who the people
            are. In these organizations, you will find sensible decisions being
            made, people working under realistic timelines, and towards goals
            that are clearly achievable through the strategies that they are
            executing upon. It is truly a joy to work in such an organization.
          </p>
        </aside>
        <p>
          But in most cases “planning sprint” is code for “prepare for damage
          control” for those who have <em>domain expertise</em> and
          <em>ability to plan</em> attributes but not the
          <em>authority</em> attribute.
        </p>
        <p>
          When people who understand neither refridgerators or elephants decide
          to solve problems, the outcome usually looks like the joke we
          mentioned before; but with the added injury of unrealistic timelines.
        </p>
        <div class="quotable">
          <p>
            Worse, when the strategies are spelled out without understanding the
            problem or the purpose of a strategy, the outcome is that those
            those doing the work
            <strong
              >must frame their work in terms of putting something into a
              refridgerator in three steps</strong
            >.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          This process is extra fun when the planners have decided to put not
          one but <strong>two</strong> things in the refridgerator without being
          specific about what they are. We know one of those things
          <em>must</em>
          be an elephant for the long term viability of the product, but the
          other one could be an orange for all we care. So the workers now have
          to frame
          <em>“solving the elephant”</em> in terms of
          <em>“putting the elephant in the refridgerator”</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the middle management layer continues to consider the orange and
          the elephant as being roughly equal problems. Hence
          <a
            href="https://www.warp.dev/blog/problems-with-promotion-oriented-cultures"
            >those who play the ladder game</a
          >
          know to work on the orange and not touch the elephant.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is surprising how few good decisions need to be made in order to
          keep a multi-billion dollar enterprise chugging along – at least as
          far as investors are concerned. You should begin to understand why a
          company with so many smart people and so many brilliant creations can
          make so many self-defeating mistakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is not suprising is the amount of fat that constitutes the middle
          management of these companies. The
          <a

            >thermocline of truth</a
          >
          ensures that those looking down from the top will never see the fat
          for what it is.

                  If you don't know what a refridgerator is nor what an elephant
                  is you are likely to think that opening the door, putting the
                  elephant in, and closing the door is a viable strategy for
                  putting an elephant in the refridgerator.

                  Intellectual catchment areas are collaborative ecosystems
                  between universities and industries that attract talent and
                  ideas. The United States became a hub of intellectual capital
                  after World War II, thanks to a combination of industrial
                  growth around universities, significant research funding, and
                  favorable immigration policies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The current political climate is jeopardizing these
                  ecosystems. Continued threats against universities and
                  immigration could undo a century of progress, ultimately
                  depleting the nation's source of creativity and innovation.
