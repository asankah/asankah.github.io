          Privacy, security, inclusion, equity, accessibility, … all of these
          have an interesting property in common. When evaluation products
          against such questions you are usually trying to establish a negative.
        </p>
        <h3 id="to-prove-a-negative">To Prove A Negative</h3>
        <p>
          Proving a negative requires providing
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence"
            >evidence of absence</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          If one wanted to <em>disprove</em> the claim
          <em>“all primes are odd”</em> one only needs to prove
          <em>“some primes are even”</em>. The latter can be accomplished by
          finding a single counterexample – the number 2. On the other hand if
          one wanted to <em>prove</em> the claim, they would need establish that
          all primes are odd. Another example is the claim
          <em>“there are no vermin in this house,”</em> proving which requires
          an exahustive search of the premises. Once again, disproving the claim
          only requires a single piece of evidence – a mouse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going back to the beginning, asking someone whether a product is
          <em>secure</em>, <em>private</em>, <em>inclusive</em>,
          <em>accessible</em> etc… fall into the same category. Answering these
          questions require proving that there is nothing <em>insecure</em>,
          <em>privacy violating</em>, <em>non-inclusive</em>, or
          <em>inaccessible</em> about this product. These questions are even
          worse than the one about vermin from before because it’s not even
          clear where to start looking. People who have spent their entire
          careers studying the subject would find the criteria difficult or
          downright impossible to evaluate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite this apparent futility, there is hope.
          <strong
            >Knowing that the criteria holds under a limited set of
            circumstances is sometimes enough</strong
          >. Often it is the best that we can do.
        </p>
        <h3 id="proof-by-enumeration">Proof By Enumeration</h3>
        <p>
          In security and privacy parlance this limited scope is called the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model"
            ><em>threat model</em></a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Absolute security is impossible, so one would start by establishing
          the specific threats that they would like to deal with. For example
          when considering the security of a networked application one could
          start by drawing out a
          <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/data-flow-diagram"
            >data flow diagram</a
          >
          and then going over the different points at which data would be at
          risk of being compromised. Enumeration of vulnerabilities and threats
          in this way opens up the possibility of thoroughly examining the
          <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/attack-surface">attack surface</a
          >. Thus the previously intractable problem becomes finite.
        </p>
        <p>
          As our understanding of threats improve, so does the effectiveness of
          the threat model. Historically, understanding this kind of problem
          space takes time and many – often costly – mistakes. The boundaries
          sometimes only become known when someone exploits it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, when evaluating a squishy concept like inclusion and equity
          one would also start with a well defined scope that lends itself to
          examination. Just like before, often we only learn where to look for
          problems the hard way. So we come up with methodologies like carefully
          curated <strong>dimensions of identity</strong>. Enumerations like
          that give us a finite set of things to consider with our finite
          resources. Additionally these methodologies also grant us a taxonomy
          with which we can organize our hard earned knowledge on the topic.
        </p>
        <h3 id="proof-by-enumerating-product-outcomes">
          Proof by Enumerating Product Outcomes
        </h3>
        <p>
          Enumeration based approaches establish clusters of
          <em>possible product outcomes</em> which we can then evaluate
          individually.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, a product that processes pictures of people can be
          evaluated based on the outcome of handling pictures of people with
          different skin tokes, gender expressions, body types, ages, hair and
          accesories, visible disabilities, and lighting conditions. Coming up
          with these outcomes can be laborious and expensive, but it is
          tractable. Costs of curating suitably detailed test cases and data
          sets should amortize across their potentially broad applicability.
        </p>
        <h3 id="proof-by-construction">Proof By Construction</h3>
        <p>
          But sometimes the set of outcomes do not cluster effectively or are
          too numerous to exhaustively evaluate. In security this would be
          similar to asking whether some software system is free from
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow"
            >buffer overruns</a
          >
          – a question that is theoretically impossible to answer in general if
          the method of construction is not amenable to analysis. The best we
          could do is for suitably skilled persons to go through the code with a
          fine toothed comb looking for potential problems; a task that is both
          impractical as it is prone to error.
        </p>
        <h3 id="proof-by-process-of-construction">
          Proof by Process of Construction
        </h3>
        <p>
          Instead we could try using programming languages that provide certain
          safety guarantees:
          <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/memory-safe-programming-languages"
            >memory-safe languages</a
          >. These safety guarantees establish the memory safety of the
          resulting behavior as a consequence of the method by which the
          underlying software is constructed. Another method we can use is to
          continue using an unsafe language<a
            href="#fn1"
            class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref1"
            role="doc-noteref"
            interestfor="ref-1-preview"
            style="anchor-name: --ref-1-preview-anchor"
            ><sup>1</sup></a
          >, but invest in development practices like
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">fuzz testing</a> which
          give us sufficient
          <a
            href="https://www.georgefairbanks.com/ieee-software-v37-n3-may-2020-testing-numbs-us-to-our-loss-of-intellectual-control"
            >statistical control</a
          >
          over the behavior of our software.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Inclusion and equity</em> can follow a similar paradigm where we
          establish certain process requirements that also yield a favorable
          outcome with a high likelihood. Google’s
          <a href="https://design.google/library/building-for-everyone"
            >Building for Everyone</a
          >
          outlines some of these processes criteria such as involving a diverse
          group of people during the ideation and design phases of a product,
          and involving a diverse group of people during testing. Once again,
          these approaches don’t guarantee success, but have a much higher
          likelihood of delivering a favorable outcome.
        </p>
        <h3 id="amalgam-engineering">Amalgam Engineering</h3>
        <p>
          Increasingly software systems are built as amalgamations of systems
          that are themselves complex. The behavior of each constituent is
          difficult to reason about let alone the behavior of the amalgamation.
        </p>
        <p>
          To establish some desirable property of the amalgamation, it becomes
          necessary to progressively establish the same or minor properties of
          the constituents.
          <strong
            >The point of establishing these properties is to yield a simpler
            more tractable model of a system</strong
          >
          that we can readily reason about. We can then infer or at least
          approximate the behavior of the amalgamation based on the simplified
          models that we derive of the contituents.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don’t expect this situation to get better given that many of these
          contituent parts will be ML models that are too complex for us to
          understand. As enumerating product outcomes becomes less effective, we
          will need to rely ever more on process criteria and governance of
          construction to curb the product outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The accuracy of the resulting simplified models is all that we will
          have to grasp in order to have some say how technology will govern us
          in turn.

                  Lifecycles of software systems that solve real world problems
                  can be broken down into distinct phases based on where it is
                  with respect to the problem and the eventual solution.

                <p>
                  This article presents a taxonomy of these phases that should
                  help you understand how each part of the lifecycle fits
                  together.
