</a><a href=https://xn--izc.com/posts/on-wontfixing-bugs/ aria-label="Permanent link to post"><img src=/images/link-2.svg alt="Permanent link to post"></a></div><p>This was partly inspired by a Tweet by a co-worker. The tweet is:</p><blockquote class=twitter-tweet><p lang=en dir=ltr>wontfix-ing valid bugs (that have been triaged as such) with bots because you haven't been able to fix or prioritize them yet is kinda hostile to contributors, imho <a href=https://t.co/faxtbpoiII>pic.twitter.com/faxtbpoiII</a></p>&mdash; Mike Taylor (@miketaylr) <a href="https://twitter.com/miketaylr/status/1366762904851279877?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 2, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src=https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js></script><p>For projects that are under-resourced but has heavy usage it is in
fact quite normal to accumulate a large number of issue reports over
time. Take Chromium for example. There are (at the time of writing)
~95,000 open bugs. Many of these are task tracking bugs rather than
tracking actual product bugs. But still that’s a lot of real bugs.</p><p>What’s even more interesting is the accumulation of bugs. Typically
for a “successful” project the rate of new issues being reported will
exceed the rate of issues being fixed. Hence the growth.</p><h2 id=what-matters>What Matters …</h2><p>Issues are often annotated to indicate some measure of
<em>severity</em> and <em>priority</em>. These are two different axes of
measurement:</p><p><strong>Severity</strong> refers to the degree of impact that an
issue has. How many users are affected? Is the effect isolated or spread
across a large user base? Severity is supposed to summarize the answer
to these questions.</p><p><strong>Priority</strong> refers to what the issue triagers deemed to
be the relative importance of the issue. A bug that affects a large
number of users – hence a high severity – might not be a high priority
due to mitigating factors. Typically a project owner would tackle higher
priority issues first. Under-resourced projects – which is the case for
pretty much every successful project I’ve seen – will accumulate lower
priority issues across time.</p><p>Neither <em>severity</em> nor <em>priority</em> are static either. An
issue with a low severity might be elevated to a higher severity if the
affected population of users is discovered to be larger than originally
assumed. Or the priority may be raised if the issue is blocking the fix
for another more severe issue. It’s not uncommon for some low priority
issue to be suddenly elevated to critical status once someone figures
out how to exploit it.</p><p>In practice <em>perceptual priority</em> is the only one that
matters. It doesn’t matter what the issue tracker label or score is.
What matters is that there’s a contributor who’s motivated to fix it.
The decisions of a contributor are complex and subjective. So while the
most important issues will <em>likely</em> get fixed, just because an
issue is real or important doesn’t mean that it will be addressed.</p><p>What this means is that it is important for issue reports to stick
around. At worst they will accumulate more evidence of severity or clues
to what the issue is. Often the desired outcome isn’t universal either.
So an issue report also functions as an opinion catchment area where
interested parties can hash out their differences.</p><h2 id=and-what-doesnt>And What Doesn’t …</h2><p>However, the health of the project then depends on not only handling
new issues, but also in how they shepherd existing or known issues.</p><p>Much like any other todo list, the effectiveness of the issue tracker
decreases when there’s an overwhelming number of items to look at. The
cognitive overhead of correct prioritizing increases dramatically, as
does the time it takes for triaging.</p><h2 id=strategies-that-dont-work>Strategies That Don’t Work …</h2><p>So projects tend to use various techniques to deal with the growing
pile of issues. The more overwhelming it is, the more drastic the
mitigation strategy.</p><p>One such strategy in action is what we see in the Tweet above where
there’s a bot that automatically closes old issues that haven’t seen any
activity. At first glance this seems to make sense.</p><p>The assumption seems to be that if the issue was important enough
then an endless stream of users would pipe up on the bug with “me too”s
to keep the issue open. The issue tracker is now a battlefield where
issue reporters have to continually work to keep the issue alive until a
contributor takes pity and addresses it.</p><p>Issue reporters themselves who are often volunteers who are electing
to participate in a project can also burn out. If the issues they file
are automatically closed, it’s frustrating to the reporters. Chances are
that with every few issues that are closed due to inactivity, the
project loses a contributor.</p><p>Another strategy is to have new issues start at some sort of
<em>unconfirmed</em> state. Once the issue has been acknowledged and
accepted it can proceed to some other state which makes the issue become
a candidate for contributor consideration. This one is a bit better in
that it doesn’t discard <em>confirmed</em> issues.</p><p>However, eventually the real issues will accumulate to the point
where some sort of bookkeeping is needed. Along comes
<code>WontFix</code> and friends. This is a state where the issue is
marked as <em>“this is a real issue but we will probably never get
around to fixing it.”</em></p><p>Reporters nevertheless find this state to be no-less frustrating than
an outright closure. <code>WontFix</code>ed bugs don’t show up by
default in issue searches, so they are effectively undiscoverable to
future issue reporters. All time invested in that issue is now lost.</p><h2 id=and-one-that-does>And One That Does? …</h2><p>The alternative is to just leave the issue open, but lower the
priority down to something that reflects the current opinion of the
project maintainers.</p><p>This strategy acknowledges that the issue is real. It serves as
documentation that the product has a known defect, and in addition it
can serve the purposes of accumulating evidence of severity along the
way. If the issue becomes prominent enough then it can be retriaged.</p><p>That’s it. So far I haven’t seen alternatives that are much better
than this. I’m generally against mass issue closing events like
declaring “bug bankruptcy.” The bugs don’t care about the state of the
issue report. All you’ve accomplished is to throw away the accumulated
history and evidence of a defect.</p></div><div class=pagination><a href=/posts/poisson-distribution/ class="left arrow">&#8592;</a>
