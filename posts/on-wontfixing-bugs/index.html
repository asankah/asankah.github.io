      <main itemprop="articleBody" class="container">
        <p>This was partly inspired by a Tweet by a co-worker. The tweet is:</p>
        <p>https://twitter.com/miketaylr/status/1366762904851279877”</p>
        <p>
          For projects that are under-resourced but has heavy usage it is in
          fact quite normal to accumulate a large number of issue reports over
          time. Take Chromium for example. There are (at the time of writing)
          ~95,000 open bugs. Many of these are task tracking bugs rather than
          tracking actual product bugs. But still that’s a lot of real bugs.
        </p>
        <p>
          What’s even more interesting is the accumulation of bugs. Typically
          for a “successful” project the rate of new issues being reported will
          exceed the rate of issues being fixed. Hence the growth.
        </p>
        <h2 id="what-matters">What Matters …</h2>
        <p>
          Issues are often annotated to indicate some measure of
          <em>severity</em> and <em>priority</em>. These are two different axes
          of measurement:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Severity</strong> refers to the degree of impact that an issue
          has. How many users are affected? Is the effect isolated or spread
          across a large user base? Severity is supposed to summarize the answer
          to these questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Priority</strong> refers to what the issue triagers deemed to
          be the relative importance of the issue. A bug that affects a large
          number of users – hence a high severity – might not be a high priority
          due to mitigating factors. Typically a project owner would tackle
          higher priority issues first. Under-resourced projects – which is the
          case for pretty much every successful project I’ve seen – will
          accumulate lower priority issues across time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither <em>severity</em> nor <em>priority</em> are static either. An
          issue with a low severity might be elevated to a higher severity if
          the affected population of users is discovered to be larger than
          originally assumed. Or the priority may be raised if the issue is
          blocking the fix for another more severe issue. It’s not uncommon for
          some low priority issue to be suddenly elevated to critical status
          once someone figures out how to exploit it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice <em>perceptual priority</em> is the only one that matters.
          It doesn’t matter what the issue tracker label or score is. What
          matters is that there’s a contributor who’s motivated to fix it. The
          decisions of a contributor are complex and subjective. So while the
          most important issues will <em>likely</em> get fixed, just because an
          issue is real or important doesn’t mean that it will be addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          What this means is that it is important for issue reports to stick
          around. At worst they will accumulate more evidence of severity or
          clues to what the issue is. Often the desired outcome isn’t universal
          either. So an issue report also functions as an opinion catchment area
          where interested parties can hash out their differences.
        </p>
        <h2 id="and-what-doesnt">And What Doesn’t …</h2>
        <p>
          However, the health of the project then depends on not only handling
          new issues, but also in how they shepherd existing or known issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much like any other todo list, the effectiveness of the issue tracker
          decreases when there’s an overwhelming number of items to look at. The
          cognitive overhead of correct prioritizing increases dramatically, as
          does the time it takes for triaging.
        </p>
        <h2 id="strategies-that-dont-work">Strategies That Don’t Work …</h2>
        <p>
          So projects tend to use various techniques to deal with the growing
          pile of issues. The more overwhelming it is, the more drastic the
          mitigation strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          One such strategy in action is what we see in the Tweet above where
          there’s a bot that automatically closes old issues that haven’t seen
          any activity. At first glance this seems to make sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          The assumption seems to be that if the issue was important enough then
          an endless stream of users would pipe up on the bug with “me too”s to
          keep the issue open. The issue tracker is now a battlefield where
          issue reporters have to continually work to keep the issue alive until
          a contributor takes pity and addresses it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Issue reporters themselves who are often volunteers who are electing
          to participate in a project can also burn out. If the issues they file
          are automatically closed, it’s frustrating to the reporters. Chances
          are that with every few issues that are closed due to inactivity, the
          project loses a contributor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another strategy is to have new issues start at some sort of
          <em>unconfirmed</em> state. Once the issue has been acknowledged and
          accepted it can proceed to some other state which makes the issue
          become a candidate for contributor consideration. This one is a bit
          better in that it doesn’t discard <em>confirmed</em> issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, eventually the real issues will accumulate to the point where
          some sort of bookkeeping is needed. Along comes
          <code>WontFix</code> and friends. This is a state where the issue is
          marked as
          <em
            >“this is a real issue but we will probably never get around to
            fixing it.”</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Reporters nevertheless find this state to be no-less frustrating than
          an outright closure. <code>WontFix</code>ed bugs don’t show up by
          default in issue searches, so they are effectively undiscoverable to
          future issue reporters. All time invested in that issue is now lost.
        </p>
        <h2 id="and-one-that-does">And One That Does? …</h2>
        <p>
          The alternative is to just leave the issue open, but lower the
          priority down to something that reflects the current opinion of the
          project maintainers.
        </p>
        <p>
          This strategy acknowledges that the issue is real. It serves as
          documentation that the product has a known defect, and in addition it
          can serve the purposes of accumulating evidence of severity along the
          way. If the issue becomes prominent enough then it can be retriaged.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s it. So far I haven’t seen alternatives that are much better
          than this. I’m generally against mass issue closing events like
          declaring “bug bankruptcy.” The bugs don’t care about the state of the
          issue report. All you’ve accomplished is to throw away the accumulated
          history and evidence of a defect.

                  time. This is normal. Typically for a &quot;successful&quot;

                  Line-length and line-spacing slightly affect the ergonomics of
                  reading on the web, but not significantly. However, evidence
                  suggests that adults prefer &quot;medium&quot; length columns
                  of text.
