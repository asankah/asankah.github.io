        <p>It’s been a while since I’ve published anything here. This is partly
          because every time I write, there is something much more important and
          terrible happenning in the world that I’m not qualified to write about.
          Writing about some technical topic seems like a triviality compared to
          world events.</p>
        <p>Many years ago I’d have said that there is very little evil in the
          world and that most people you will meet are good natured. I still sort
          of believe that people are good natured, but I’m beginning to think that
          the word <em>“most”</em> may not be so easily applied to that
          statement.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./do-not-press.png" class="noinvert" alt="A big red button labelled DO NOT PRESS is attached to the top of an ominous looking device to which many wires and conduits are attached.">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">A big red button labelled <strong>DO NOT
PRESS</strong> is attached to the top of an ominous looking device to
            which many wires and conduits are attached.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>School children has this <em>would-you-rather</em> question about a
          big red button. Hypothetically speaking, if there were a big red button
          that when pushed gives you a million dollars, but also kills a random
          person, would you press it?</p>
        <p>It is safe to say that the answer to this question, in practice, is
          predominently <em>yes</em>.</p>
        <p>More worryingly, the reward doesn’t need to be nearly that high. It
          seems, at least for some, there doesn’t need to be a reward at all as
          long as the person who would be harmed is of a specific race, sexual
          orientation, body dysmorphia, or religion. harming a person that one
          does not like is apparently reward enough.</p>
        <p>People aren’t born this way. I think decades of being conditioned to
          cast out a group of people gradually normalizes bringing harm to them.
          With enough rhetoric and likemindedness anything can be normalized.
          Anyone disagreeing – and is not a member of the outcasts – can be easily
          disregarded as being the enemy or at least misguided. Hate becomes
          self-sustaining, and can last generations.</p>
        <p>We can win battles or wars, but we are not going to really move
          forward as a species unless we figure this one out – how do we teach
          compassion, and how do we convince someone away from hate?</p>
        <p>Contrary to popular opinion I think pushing the hateful away is not a
          sustainable solution in the long run. Suppressing hateful speech without
          corrective guidance has historically just made the hateful group more
          resentful and even more entrenched in their beliefs. Ultimately they
          will – as evidenced in recent events – have enough momentum and
          intensity to turn the tables.</p>
