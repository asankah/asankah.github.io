          It’s been a while since I’ve published anything here. This is partly
          because every time I try to write there is something much more
          important and terrible happenning in the world that I’m not qualified
          to write about. Everything else including whatever it was that I was
          trying to write about seems trivial and inconsequential by comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many years ago I’d have said that there is very little evil in the
          world and that most people you will meet are good. I still sort of
          believe that people are good, but I’m beginning to think that the word
          <em>“most”</em> may not be readily applicable.
        </p>

          />
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">
            A big red button labelled <strong>DO NOT PRESS</strong> is attached
            to the top of an ominous looking device to which many wires and
            conduits are attached.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          School children has this <em>would-you-rather</em> question about a
          big red button.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “Hypothetically, if there were a big red button that when pushed
            gives you a million dollars, but also kills a random person, would
            you press it?”
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          It is safe to say that the answer to this question is predominently
          <em>yes</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          More worryingly, the reward doesn’t need to be nearly that high. It
          seems, for some, there doesn’t need to be a reward at all as long as
          the person who would be harmed is of a specific race, sexual
          orientation, body dysmorphia, where they were born, or religion.
          There’s enough hate to take the place of a reward.
        </p>
        <p>
          People aren’t born this way. Decades of being conditioned to cast out
          a group of people gradually dehumanizes them. With enough rhetoric,
          likemindedness, and reinforcement anything can be normalized. Anyone
          disagreeing – and is not a member of the outcasts – can be easily
          disregarded as being the enemy or at least misguided. Hate becomes
          self-sustaining, and can last generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can win battles or wars, but we are not going to really move
          forward as a species unless we figure this one out – how to teach
          compassion, and how to reason someone away from hate?
        </p>
        <p>
          Contrary to popular opinion I think pushing the hateful away is not a
          sustainable solution in the long run. Suppressing hateful behavior
          without corrective guidance has historically just made the hateful
          group more resentful and even more entrenched in their beliefs.
          Ultimately they will – as evidenced in recent events – have enough
          momentum and intensity to turn the tables.

                Claude Shannon's
                <em>A mathematical theory of communication</em> is an oft cited
                classic in information theory. Let's dive in and try to tease
                apart the &quot;why&quot;s that are often overlooked when people
                build on top of the introduced theory. They are definitely
                things that I didn't consider to be obvious without the benefit
                of reading the paper.

                In networking, adding too much buffering to intermediate network
                devices introduce unnecessary delays. The trade-off is that
                <em>bursty</em> traffic will have the appearance of getting
                through faster. But in reality, the speed of the network is
                still the same. Data just takes longer to get through.
