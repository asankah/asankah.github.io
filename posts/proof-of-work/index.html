refers to a set of methods by which some entity (a person or a
computational system) offers proof that the entity performed a
substantial amount of work. Hereafter, I’ll assume that you—dear
reader—are somewhat familiar with the concept.</p></div><p>Measures like proof-of-work (PoW) are a necessity in
<strong>intentionally slowing down</strong> otherwise free and
uncontrolled operations. PoW’s most extensive critique is the resulting
high resource consumption that lacks a corresponding commensurate
positive contribution.</p><div class=quotable><p>Working with a poorly thought-out, or overengineered technology
stack, or an overly bureaucratic organization is <em>also a form of
proof-of-work</em>.</p></div><p>This claim seems harsh, but even the intentionality of PoW can be
observed in organizations.</p><p>The first tool people reach for wherever some form of mismatched
trust exists is to introduce bureaucracy. This approach makes sense
because what better way to prevent abuse of authority than to make the
person at a lower trust level ask for permission from someone with a
higher trust level? So, each trust issue one encounters results in one
more approval hurdle – affectionately referred to sometimes as a
“governance gate” or an “approval gate.”</p><p>Now, take a step back and imagine how the proliferation of approval
gates plays out in a large organization like Google. All organizational
activity now involves debilitating bureaucratic overhead. Proliferation
of approvals also have the effect of piling on the responsibility of
approving upon people who are either unqualified to sufficiently assess
the request or simply have no time to go through each in detail.</p><p>Unless each approval gate adds substantial value or prevents harm,
each such approval decays into proof-of-work –</p><div class=quotable><p>the only point of getting the approval is to show that you have gone
through the work of getting the approval.</p></div><p>Bad frameworks and tech stacks have the same effect. Onboarding onto
such a stack is a time-wasting nightmare where people learn
non-transferrable skills that they will most likely only use once. Each
step in getting something done involves putting together poorly
documented and poorly designed pieces and trying to express business
logic in leaky abstractions that muddle the separation between intent
and implementation. Sprikle an inordinate amount of approval gates on
top, and you have our modern large tech company.</p><p>The outcome of weeks of struggle is the same as what is achievable
within a matter of hours with a better tech stack. You haven’t produced
work; you’ve only produced proof of work. The outcome isn’t commensurate
with the effort.</p></div><div class=pagination><a href=/posts/how-to-solve-a-problem-in-three-steps/ class="left arrow">&#8592;</a>
