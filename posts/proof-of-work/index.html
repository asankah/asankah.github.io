          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work">Proof-of-work</a>
            refers to a set of methods by which some entity (a person or a
            computational system) offers proof that the entity performed a
            substantial amount of work. Hereafter, I’ll assume that you—dear
            reader—are somewhat familiar with the concept.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Measures like proof-of-work (PoW) are a necessity in
          <strong>intentionally slowing down</strong> otherwise free and
          uncontrolled operations. PoW’s most extensive critique is the resulting
          high resource consumption that lacks a corresponding commensurate
          positive contribution.
        </p>
        <div class="quotable">
          <p>Working with a poorly thought-out, or overengineered technology
            stack, or an overly bureaucratic organization is <em>also a form of
proof-of-work</em>.</p>
        </div>
        <p>This claim seems harsh, but even the intentionality of PoW can be
          observed in organizations.</p>
        <p>The first tool people reach for wherever some form of mismatched
          trust exists is to introduce bureaucracy. This approach makes sense
          because what better way to prevent abuse of authority than to make the
          person at a lower trust level ask for permission from someone with a
          higher trust level? So, each trust issue one encounters results in one
          more approval hurdle – affectionately referred to sometimes as a
          “governance gate” or an “approval gate.”</p>
        <p>Now, take a step back and imagine how the proliferation of approval
          gates plays out in a large organization like Google. All organizational
          activity now involves debilitating bureaucratic overhead. Proliferation
          of approvals also have the effect of piling on the responsibility of
          approving upon people who are either unqualified to sufficiently assess
          the request or simply have no time to go through each in detail.</p>
        <p>Unless each approval gate adds substantial value or prevents harm,
          each such approval decays into proof-of-work –</p>
        <div class="quotable">
          <p>the only point of getting the approval is to show that you have gone
            through the work of getting the approval.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Bad frameworks and tech stacks have the same effect. Onboarding onto
          such a stack is a time-wasting nightmare where people learn
          non-transferrable skills that they will most likely only use once. Each
          step in getting something done involves putting together poorly
          documented and poorly designed pieces and trying to express business
          logic in leaky abstractions that muddle the separation between intent
          and implementation. Sprikle an inordinate amount of approval gates on
          top, and you have our modern large tech company.</p>
        <p>The outcome of weeks of struggle is the same as what is achievable
          within a matter of hours with a better tech stack. You haven’t produced
          work; you’ve only produced proof of work. The outcome isn’t commensurate
          with the effort.</p>

            <p>Large projects accumulate a large number of issue reports over time. This
              is normal. Typically for a &quot;successful&quot; project the rate of new issues
              being reported will exceed the rate of issues being fixed. Hence the
