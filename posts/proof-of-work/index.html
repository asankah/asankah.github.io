            refers to a set of methods by which some entity (a person or a
            computational system) offers proof that the entity performed a
            substantial amount of work. Hereafter, I’ll assume that you—dear
            reader—are somewhat familiar with the concept.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Measures like proof-of-work (PoW) are a necessity in
          <strong>intentionally slowing down</strong> otherwise free and
          uncontrolled operations. PoW’s most extensive critique is the
          resulting high resource consumption that lacks a corresponding
          commensurate positive contribution.
        </p>
        <div class="quotable">
          <p>
            Working with a poorly thought-out, or overengineered technology
            stack, or an overly bureaucratic organization is
            <em>also a form of proof-of-work</em>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          This claim seems harsh, but even the intentionality of PoW can be
          observed in organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first tool people reach for wherever some form of mismatched trust
          exists is to introduce bureaucracy. This approach makes sense because
          what better way to prevent abuse of authority than to make the person
          at a lower trust level ask for permission from someone with a higher
          trust level? So, each trust issue one encounters results in one more
          approval hurdle – affectionately referred to sometimes as a
          “governance gate” or an “approval gate.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, take a step back and imagine how the proliferation of approval
          gates plays out in a large organization like Google. All
          organizational activity now involves debilitating bureaucratic
          overhead. Proliferation of approvals also have the effect of piling on
          the responsibility of approving upon people who are either unqualified
          to sufficiently assess the request or simply have no time to go
          through each in detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless each approval gate adds substantial value or prevents harm,
          each such approval decays into proof-of-work –
        </p>
        <div class="quotable">
          <p>
            the only point of getting the approval is to show that you have gone
            through the work of getting the approval.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Bad frameworks and tech stacks have the same effect. Onboarding onto
          such a stack is a time-wasting nightmare where people learn
          non-transferrable skills that they will most likely only use once.
          Each step in getting something done involves putting together poorly
          documented and poorly designed pieces and trying to express business
          logic in leaky abstractions that muddle the separation between intent
          and implementation. Sprikle an inordinate amount of approval gates on
          top, and you have our modern large tech company.
        </p>
        <p>
          The outcome of weeks of struggle is the same as what is achievable
          within a matter of hours with a better tech stack. You haven’t
          produced work; you’ve only produced proof of work. The outcome isn’t
          commensurate with the effort.

                Claude Shannon's
                <em>A mathematical theory of communication</em> is an oft cited
                classic in information theory. Let's dive in and try to tease
                apart the &quot;why&quot;s that are often overlooked when people
                build on top of the introduced theory. They are definitely
                things that I didn't consider to be obvious without the benefit
                of reading the paper.

                In any team, the roles people play are not as rigid as they
                seem. Over time, people naturally settle into &quot;soft
                roles&quot; that are not explicitly defined but are crucial for
                a team's success. This is a look at the organic, and often
                unsung, ways that successful teams actually work.
