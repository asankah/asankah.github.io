        <p>
          After much dillydallying about which note-taker/ebook reader I wanted
          to get, I went ahead and got a
          <a href="https://remarkable.com/">reMarkable 2</a>. I’ve been using it
          for about a month now. I must say that it’s the closest thing to
          writing on paper that I have encountered.
        </p>
        <p>My requirements of a note-taking tablet were:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Replace my paper notebooks.</li>
          <li>
            Quickly transfer diagrams and drawings to the computer/laptop.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Replacing a paper notebook is a tall order. A paper notebook is …</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ready as soon as I open it.</li>
          <li>Lightweight.</li>
          <li>Durable.</li>
          <li>Can be used with a comfortable pen.</li>
          <li>Doesn’t make my eyes tired.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>An Unsuccessful Attempt With A Pixelbook</h2>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="/posts/remarkable-first-impressions/GJMldsg6r6-732.png"
            alt=""

            height="541"
          />
          <figcaption>
            A Pixelbook like this was my first attempt at using a tablet for
            note-taking.
            <a href="https://www.google.com/chromebookdevice/google-pixelbook/"
              >(Image source)</a
            >
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          NOTE: The comments below <em>only</em> apply to the Chromebook Pixel’s
          utility as a note-taking device. It is, of course, far more than a
          note-taking device and will likely be a better choice for you if you
          want to use the web, consume lots of eBooks, or otherwise need the
          functionality of a modern laptop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The
          <a href="https://www.google.com/chromebook/device/google-pixelbook/"
            >Pixelbook</a
          ><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>
          was my first attempt at using a tablet for note-taking. Unfortunately,
          while it had other advantages, the Pixelbook falls far short on
          convenience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ad-hoc note-taking is a hassle. Getting started requires logging in.
          There are good reasons for needing signing-in, and it does have an
          option to use the built-in sketch app from the lock screen using the
          Pixelbook pen. But the sketch app doesn’t suffice as a note-taking
          app.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do like the privacy model of the Pixelbook’s lock screen sketch app
          – namely, that the note drops into a black box that only the owner can
          open. However, I wish the reMarkable could have a feature where adding
          a new note doesn’t simultaneously require viewing every note on the
          device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once folded over, I get paranoid about the keys underneath. Can I
          place it on a table without worrying too much? It’s anxiety-inducing.
          It’s also a laptop, which means that someone who’s easily distracted
          would be … easily distracted.
        </p>
        <p>So over to the reMarkable…</p>
        <h2>Moderate Success With The Remarkable 2</h2>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="/posts/remarkable-first-impressions/J3_5OmZ-7u-379.png"
            alt=""
            width="379"
            height="285"
          />
          <figcaption>
            The reMarkable 2 was my next choice.
            <a href="https://remarkable.com/">(Image Source)</a>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          First of all, this is a note-taking device. You should not expect much
          more from it. I thought it would make for a good ebook reader and
          journal article reader – it is neither. Its support for ebooks is
          limited to PDFs and EPUBs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m still looking for a satisfactory method of keeping a set of
          journal articles synchronized between my laptop and the reMarkable
          tablet. The current method is to go through their proprietary cloud
          service, which I can only do for my personal usage but not for work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once again,
          <strong>this is neither a laptop nor an ebook reader</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are, however, two important points to note about the reMarkable
          tablet:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            It’s the closest I’ve seen to writing on paper. The hardware is
            pretty much spot on.
          </li>
          <li>
            There’s an active community of hackers who constantly push the
            tablet’s capabilities.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The second point bears repeating. The biggest thing going for the
          reMarkable tablet right now is the developer community surrounding it.
          Have a gander at the
          <a href="https://remarkablewiki.com/">reMarkableWiki</a>’s
          <a href="https://remarkablewiki.com/tips/start">Tips and Tricks</a>
          page or the
          <a href="https://github.com/reHackable/awesome-reMarkable"
            >Awesome reMarkable</a
          >
          list. Some highlights include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ability to use third-party clouds or local storage for synchronizing
            your reMakable documents (via
            <a href="https://remarkablewiki.com/tips/rclone">rclone</a> or
            <a href="https://github.com/simonschllng/rm-sync">rm-sync</a> or
            many other options).
          </li>
          <li>
            Setting up an email address to which you can email documents which
            will appear on your reMarkable (via
            <a href="https://remarkablenewsletter.com/">reMarkable Newsletter</a
            >).
          </li>
          <li>
            Stream your reMarkable screen (via
            <a
              href="https://blog.afandian.com/2020/10/pipes-and-paper-remarkable/"
              >pipes and paper</a
            >, <a href="https://github.com/rien/reStream">reStream</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/bordaigorl/rmview">rMview</a>, or
            others).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you are into tinkering with electronics, the reMarkable will
          provide ample entertainment in addition to note-taking.
        </p>
        <h2>Workflows</h2>
        <p>
          The process of making myself at home with the reMarkable 2 involved
          coming up with good workflows for the things that I want to do with
          it. My goal here is to reduce the overhead as much as possible.
          Although a paper notebook is close to ideal for writing things down,
          it’s not easy to get that content out to an electronic format. I hope
          that the reMarkable 2 will keep the former as-is while significantly
          improving the latter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not all notes are equal. Some are ad-hoc sketches and doodles. Some
          need to be a bit more longevity, like daily diary entries. Some are
          drafts of design documents, diagrams, or blog posts that I’d need to
          move over to an electronic format. Then there are work-related things
          like interview notes and meeting notes. So we have three overall
          workflows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Missives that I may want to keep around only to satisfy some sort of
            hoarding instinct.
          </li>
          <li>
            Notes that I want to transcribe into some electronic form. If the
            originals are to be kept, they must be labeled or categorized
            somehow.
            <ol>
              <li>Pictures or diagrams.</li>
              <li>Text.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Notes that, regardless of whether any transcription is needed, carry
            confidential or proprietary information.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Of these, the first one is trivial. Pull out the device, write stuff,
          move on with life. If necessary, I can always look at the recent
          notes, but I will likely never look at anything older than a month.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second one is easy if you are using the
          <a href="https://remarkable.com/store/connect">Connect cloud</a>.
          There are multiple integrations that they already have for moving
          content to other cloud providers, including conversion to different
          image formats. The Connect cloud also handles the work of extracting
          text from what you’ve written. In my experience, the handwriting
          recognition results have been quite good though they require the
          occasional cleanup.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third one is tricky. Again, sidestepping the Connect cloud
          offering, the aforementioned hacking resources really help get
          material from the device onto your machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ll leave the details for another blog post, but the gist of it is
          that we can quickly transfer the contents of the display as a picture
          to a laptop or desktop computer via Wifi or via USB. From there, you
          can use any number of tools to extract the text or clean up the
          drawings. With a little bit of automation, the process was more
          accessible than the Connect cloud.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Writing is as close to writing on a paper as one could get.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Tight integration with their cloud offering.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Great ecosystem of hackers who push the capabilities of the device
              far beyond the stock software.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The device lasts for days on a single charge. Their marketing
              materials mention two weeks. I haven’t pushed it that far due to
              occasionally connecting it to the laptop via USB for content
              transfer. I can, however, say that based on the battery remaining
              this claim seems to be correct in my case.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Can’t do much else other than note taking.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Relatively cheap compared to other note-taking devices.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The nib on the pen wears out quickly.</p>
            <p>
              They do include 9 additional nibs in the package, but I suspect
              that I’ll be buying more within a few months. Compare that with
              something like
              <a
                href="https://supernote.com/pages/feelwrite-self-recovery-soft-film-technology"
                >Supernote</a
              >
              which boasts that their nibs provide the same level of paper-like
              friction without as much wear.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Requires a lot of hand tinkering unless you subscribe to their
              cloud offering.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Limited support for ebook formats mean that you likely can’t read
              your purchased ebooks on this device.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              No support for labeling or organizing your notes – as of this
              writing.
            </p>
