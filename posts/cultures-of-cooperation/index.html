        <p>Typically the actions of an employee within a company depend on their
          percieved effect on a number of factors. In no specific order, they
          could be generalized into the following:</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li><strong>The self</strong> – <em>self-preservation and
self-enrichment</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>The company</strong> – <em>whomever controls the
payroll</em>. When I say “company”, I’m including the entire structure
            that produces and shares wealth with the employee. Management
            structures, co-workers (in their professional roles <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>),
            and other stakeholders all get lumped into “company” for convenience.
            The employee – whom we are assuming is not very high up in the org-chart
            – is affected by, but typically has little effect on these entities.
            Lumping all those entities into the single “company” entity keeps things
            simple for now.</li>
          <li><strong>The customers or users</strong> – <em>whose needs and
purchase decisions drive the company</em></li>
          <li><strong>Society</strong> – <em>among whom the employee
lives</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>The environment and the planet</strong> – <em>everything and
everyone else</em>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When presented with a decision like what to do when something goes
          wrong, the employee will weigh the percieved effect of their decision on
          each of these entities. Such considerations may not happen consciously,
          especially in the heat of the moment.</p>
        <p>Over time people tend to build up their own intuition around what’s
          good and what isn’t. Often a decision forces a compromise between
          serving oneself and serving the needs of the customers, company, or
          society.</p>
        <p>In an ideal world, the interests that benefit each of these classes
          will have no conflicts. The society in general will seek to look after
          each other and the environment. Individuals – the customers and users –
          in turn will seek sustainable goods and services that benefit society in
          addition to meeting their immediate needs. The customers’ values will
          guide company policies, which in turn form incentive structures around
          the employees.</p>
        <p>People who are innately concerned for the greater good are more
          likely to decide in favor of others and their environment. However,
          those who aren’t strongly guided by their moral compass will hone their
          intuitions around what is accepted around them and what is explictly
          incentivized.</p>
        <p>It is this intuition that we seek to affect with the culture that we
          build around ourselves.</p>

        <p>One of the more successful concepts at Google is the
          <strong>blameless postmortem</strong>. The <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/">SRE Book’s
            section on postmortem culture</a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> explains it in detail.
          But the most relevant bit for this article is as follows:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Removing blame from a postmortem gives people the confidence to
            escalate issues without fear. It is also important not to stigmatize
            frequent production of postmortems by a person or team. An atmosphere of
            blame risks creating a culture in which incidents and issues are swept
            under the rug, leading to greater risk for the organization</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>A cultural cornerstone the likes of a blameless postmortem naturally
          guides people towards a way of thinking that is outward facing. In the
          absence of a risk to self, an employee is much more likely to act
          towards the benefit of others. This is especially true if <em>doing the
right thing</em> is rewarded.</p>
        <h2 id="a-culture-of-punishment-and-domination">A Culture of Punishment
          and Domination</h2>
        <p>What happens when people feel constantly at risk is easy to see.
          Faults get swept under the rug, as the SRE book points out. Things that
          negatively affect the quality of good and services produced will remain
          unaddressed. Decisions will be made that are beneficial to a small
          number of people over a short period of time, at the expense of everyone
          else. Users lose trust in the company. Ultimately everything goes
          downhill.</p>
        <h2 id="current-events-at-google">Current Events at Google</h2>
        <p>A well respected engineer with a long tenure, Ian Hixie, recently
          left Google.</p>
        <p>After he left, he wrote <a href="https://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1700627373&amp;count=1">a blistering
            reflection of where Google is heading</a>. You should read it.</p>
        <p>One thing that he points out are the results of the recent layoffs at
          Google:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The effects of layoffs are insidious. Whereas before people might
            focus on the user, or at least their company, trusting that doing the
            right thing will eventually be rewarded even if it’s not strictly part
            of their assigned duties, after a layoff people can no longer trust that
            their company has their back, and they dramatically dial back any
            risk-taking. Responsibilities are guarded jealously. Knowledge is
            hoarded, because making oneself irreplaceable is the only lever one has
            to protect oneself from future layoffs.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>While at an individual level people may not alter their behaviors
          that much, on aggregate the results will be obvious. Ironically, a
          company that understood how strongly people reacted to a few seconds
          difference in response speed<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> somehow thought it would
          be business as usual after laying off thousands of people.</p>
