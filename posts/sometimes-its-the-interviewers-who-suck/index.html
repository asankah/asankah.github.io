        <p>I’ve done hundreds of interviews. I’ve also served in numerous hiring
          committees over the years.</p>
        <p>Tech companies tend to have cultures built around tech people
          interviewing other tech people, typically in what is
          not-so-affectionately known as the “Tech interview.” This is good
          because candidates would be evaluated based on their actual skills
          instead of keywords in their resume. Interviewers are in effect choosing
          their future coworkers which makes in interview serve the interest of
          both the interviewer and the interviewee. However candidates – at least
          the one who didn’t get accepted according to exit polls – tend to hate
          these.</p>
        <p>The goal of the tech interview is to assess how well the candidate
          will be able to perform in the role as a tech worker. Unfortunately the
          typical problems that one would encounter during the course of a career
          in tech aren’t easy to replicate within a 40-60 minute interview. So
          partly the criticism is around the fact that such interviews bear little
          resemblance to what the actual job would entail. Deciphering what
          happens during an interview and distilling it into a prediction of
          future success is quite difficult in the best of times.</p>
        <p>Making this much worse is the undeniable fact that many if not most
          <em>tech workers are just not good interviewers</em>.
        </p>
        <p>This is as true as a claim that most tech workers aren’t good
          managers – whether it’s managing projects or people. Interview follow-up
          don’t take this factor into consideration quite as much as they
          should.</p>
        <p>My anecdotal evidence is that when presented with the artifacts from
          a bad interview, hiring committees will disproportionately blame the
          candidate for it. After all if the candidate was really good, they
          would’ve potentially salvaged the interview. The problem
          disproportionately affects candidates who are near the middle of the
          skill curve where things can probably go one way or the other depending
          on the combination of question asked, and caliber of the interview.</p>
        <p>Interviews at Google famously involve a bunch of paperwork where each
          interviewer is expected to produce some verbose artifacts detailing what
          happened. Since these artifacts come from the interviewer, hiring
          committees need to exercise some due diligence to discern what actually
          happened based on the writeup. So how do we go about spotting bad
          interviews?</p>
        <h2 id="the-writeup-is-terse.">The writeup is terse.</h2>
        <p>Not in and of itself a conclusive sign, but if the writeup doesn’t
          have any details that a committee could use to form a decision, it’s
          likely a sign that the interview didn’t really gather much information
          about the candidate in the first place. Typically these kinds of
          writeups are from novice interviewers who don’t know what to write
          about.</p>
        <h2 id="the-writeup-uses-adversarial-framing.">The writeup uses
          adversarial framing.</h2>
        <p>A very frequent problem specially with novice interviewers is that
          they go into the interview thinking that it is some sort of competition
          between the interviewer and the interviewee. The interviewer might
          consider it a <em>bad</em> thing if a candidate were to hit their
          question out of the park. Some of this comes from a certain level of
          imposter syndrome where they don’t want to come across as less smart
          than the candidate. Either way this mentality comes across during the
          interview as hostile or condescending.</p>
        <h2 id="the-interviewer-takes-too-much-pleasure-in-the-interviewees-misery.">The
          interviewer takes too much pleasure in the interviewee’s misery.</h2>
        <p>Each mistake is gloated on while points at which the interviewee
          obviously shone are muted.</p>
        <h2 id="the-question-is-unnecessarily-hard.">The question is
          unnecessarily hard.</h2>
        <p>Solving a hard question that requires a great deal of time and
          thought is very satisfying. But it isn’t what you do on a day-to-day
          basis.</p>
        <h2 id="the-interviewer-allows-the-interviewee-to-march-into-the-weeds-without-helping-them-back.">The
          interviewer allows the interviewee to march into the weeds without
          helping them back.</h2>
        <p>The interviewer has the luxury of having seen the question beforehand
          and also having studied possible solutions to it. They should be
          familiar enough with the question that they could spot
          misunderstandings, misconceptions, and common mistakes. How a candidate
          notices a misstep and how they dig themselves out is important to note.
          However, letting the candidate languish in a dead-end while the clock
          ticks away the remaining minutes of an interview does not help
          anyone.</p>
        <h2 id="obvious-misunderstandings-are-not-corrected.">Obvious
          misunderstandings are not corrected.</h2>
        <p>It is the interviewer’s responsibility to explain the problem
          clearly. The problem itself doesn’t need to be fully explained since
          there’s much value in seeing how a candidate explores and understands
          the problem area. However if it is obvious that the candidate has
          fundamentally misunderstood some critical aspect of the question, the
          interviewer should step in and intervene <strong>early</strong>. We all
          misunderstand things, specially when they aren’t clearly explained. It’s
          not useful to knowingly send a candidate down the wrong path.</p>
        <h2 id="the-interviewer-seemed-annoyed-or-angry.">The interviewer seemed
          annoyed or angry.</h2>
        <p>This one should be self explanatory. The candidate is anxious enough
          as it is. The interviewer should not frustrate the interviewee’s
          attempts at asking questions and seeking clarity around the question.
          It’s likely that while the problem is obvious to one, the problem area
          may be unfamiliar to others who may need extra help figuring their way
          around. In fact the ability to resolve such ambiguities and seek clarity
          are <em>good</em>. If the interviewer actively discourages such inquiry
          that’s on the interviewer – not the candidate.</p>
        <h2 id="one-interview-diverges-significantly-from-others.">One interview
          diverges significantly from others.</h2>
        <p>There’s more than one interview for a reason. If one interview
          highlights an area as being weak while another interview highlights the
          same area as being strong, then there’s something going on that needs
          scrutiny. There can be many reasons why a candidate bombs an interview.
          Not all of them say anything bad about their ability to function well in
          their job. The causes should be teased out.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>What happens when an interview is pretty much unsalvageable? It might
          be that the writeup is inconclusive due to issues such as those
          highlighted above. A committee could ignore that specific interview and
          base their decision on the other interviews, or failing that schedule
          another interview to account for the lack of decisive information.</p>
        <p>From a candidate’s point of view, it is <strong>really</strong>
          important that they report any unpleasant interactions to one’s
          recruiter immediately after the interview. This allows a recruiter to go
          to bat for you and perhaps get you another interview if appropriate.</p>
