        <p>
          I’ve done hundreds of interviews. I’ve also served in numerous hiring
          committees over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tech companies tend to have cultures built around tech people
          interviewing other tech people, typically in what is
          not-so-affectionately known as the “Tech interview.” This is good
          because candidates would be evaluated based on their actual skills
          instead of keywords in their resume. Interviewers are in effect
          choosing their future coworkers which makes the interview serve the
          interest of both the interviewer and the interviewee. However
          candidates – at least the one who didn’t get accepted according to
          exit polls – tend to hate this interview format.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of the tech interview is to assess how well the candidate
          will be able to perform in the role as a tech worker. Unfortunately
          the typical problems that one would encounter during the course of a
          career in tech aren’t easy to replicate within a 40-60 minute
          interview. So partly the criticism is around the fact that such
          interviews bear little resemblance to what the actual job would
          entail. Deciphering what happens during an interview and distilling it
          into a prediction of future success is quite difficult in the best of
          times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Making this much worse is the undeniable fact that many if not most
          <em>tech workers are just not good interviewers</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is as true as a claim that most tech workers aren’t good managers
          – whether it’s managing projects or people. Interview follow-up don’t
          take this factor into consideration quite as much as they should.
        </p>
        <p>
          My anecdotal evidence is that when presented with the artifacts from a
          bad interview, hiring committees will disproportionately blame the
          candidate for it. After all if the candidate was really good, they
          would’ve potentially salvaged the interview. The problem
          disproportionately affects candidates who are near the middle of the
          skill curve where things can probably go one way or the other
          depending on the combination of question asked, and caliber of the
          interviewer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interviews at Google famously involve a bunch of paperwork where each
          interviewer is expected to produce some verbose artifacts detailing
          what happened. Since these artifacts come from the interviewer, hiring
          committees need to exercise some due diligence to discern what
          actually happened based on the writeup. So how do we go about spotting
          bad interviews?
        </p>
        <h3 id="the-writeup-is-terse.">The writeup is terse.</h3>
        <p>
          Not in and of itself a conclusive sign, but if the writeup doesn’t
          have any details that a committee could use to form a decision, it’s
          likely a sign that the interview didn’t really gather much information
          about the candidate in the first place. Typically these kinds of
          writeups are from novice interviewers who don’t know what to write
          about.
        </p>
        <h3 id="the-writeup-uses-adversarial-framing.">
          The writeup uses adversarial framing.
        </h3>
        <p>
          A very frequent problem specially with novice interviewers is that
          they go into the interview thinking that it is some sort of
          competition between the interviewer and the interviewee. The
          interviewer might consider it a <em>bad</em> thing if a candidate were
          to hit their question out of the park. Some of this comes from a
          certain level of imposter syndrome where they don’t want to come
          across as less smart than the candidate. Either way this mentality
          comes across during the interview as hostile or condescending.
        </p>
        <h3
          id="the-interviewer-takes-too-much-pleasure-in-the-interviewees-misery."
        >
          The interviewer takes too much pleasure in the interviewee’s misery.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Each mistake is gloated on while points at which the interviewee
          obviously shone are muted.
        </p>
        <h3 id="the-question-is-unnecessarily-hard.">
          The question is unnecessarily hard.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Solving a hard question that requires a great deal of time and thought
          is very satisfying. But it isn’t what you do on a day-to-day basis.
        </p>
        <h3
          id="the-interviewer-allows-the-interviewee-to-march-into-the-weeds-without-helping-them-back."
        >
          The interviewer allows the interviewee to march into the weeds without
          helping them back.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The interviewer has the luxury of having seen the question beforehand
          and also having studied possible solutions to it. They should be
          familiar enough with the question that they could spot
          misunderstandings, misconceptions, and common mistakes. How a
          candidate notices a misstep and how they dig themselves out is
          important to note. However, letting the candidate languish in a
          dead-end while the clock ticks away the remaining minutes of an
          interview does not help anyone.
        </p>
        <h3 id="obvious-misunderstandings-are-not-corrected.">
          Obvious misunderstandings are not corrected.
        </h3>
        <p>
          It is the interviewer’s responsibility to explain the problem clearly.
          The problem itself doesn’t need to be fully explained since there’s
          much value in seeing how a candidate explores and understands the
          problem area. However if it is obvious that the candidate has
          fundamentally misunderstood some critical aspect of the question, the
          interviewer should step in and intervene <strong>early</strong>. We
          all misunderstand things, specially when they aren’t clearly
          explained. It’s not useful to knowingly send a candidate down the
          wrong path.
        </p>
        <h3 id="the-interviewer-seemed-annoyed-or-angry.">
          The interviewer seemed annoyed or angry.
        </h3>
        <p>
          This one should be self explanatory. The candidate is anxious enough
          as it is. The interviewer should not frustrate the interviewee’s
          attempts at asking questions and seeking clarity around the question.
          It’s likely that while the problem is obvious to one, the problem area
          may be unfamiliar to others who may need extra help figuring their way
          around. In fact the ability to resolve such ambiguities and seek
          clarity are <em>good</em>. If the interviewer actively discourages
          such inquiry that’s on the interviewer – not the candidate.
        </p>
        <h3 id="one-interview-diverges-significantly-from-others.">
          One interview diverges significantly from others.
        </h3>
        <p>
          There’s more than one interview for a reason. If one interview
          highlights an area as being weak while another interview highlights
          the same area as being strong, then there’s something going on that
          needs scrutiny. There can be many reasons why a candidate bombs an
          interview. Not all of them say anything bad about their ability to
          function well in their job. The causes should be teased out.
        </p>
        <p>–</p>
        <p>
          What happens when an interview is pretty much unsalvageable? It might
          be that the writeup is inconclusive due to issues such as those
          highlighted above. A committee could ignore that specific interview
          and base their decision on the other interviews, or failing that
          schedule another interview to account for the lack of decisive
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a candidate’s point of view, it is
          <strong>really</strong> important that they report any unpleasant
          interactions to one’s recruiter immediately after the interview. This
          allows a recruiter to go to bat for you and perhaps get you another
          interview if appropriate.
