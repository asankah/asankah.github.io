        <p>This is the third time I’ve tried in earnest to switch to VSCode from
          Vim (or Neovim in my case) for reasons not all of which are relevant to
          this post. But I love Vim style modal editing and I’ve grown accustomed
          to some features that aren’t present or not well emulated in <a href="https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim">VSCodeVim</a>.</p>
        <p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim">VSCode
            Neovim</a>. I was intrigued by their claim to integrate Neovim instead
          of trying to emulate Vim. After going through the code a bit I thought
          this extension alone warranted a new attempt at switching to VSCode. So
          far it’s going great.</p>
        <h2 id="how-vscode-neovim-works">How VSCode Neovim Works</h2>
        <p>Here’s the gist of how this extension works. Feel free to skip to the
          good stuff below but this section is good background information for
          understanding <em>why</em> it works the way it does.</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p><strong>Invokes an embedded Neovim instance.</strong></p>
            <p>Code for this is in the <code>main_controller.ts</code> (<a href="https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim/blob/master/src/main_controller.ts">linky</a>)
              if you are curious about how exactly it’s implemented and the
              commandline options that are passed in.</p>
            <p>You’ll also notice that the code invokes
              <code>--cmd source ${neovimSupportScriptPath}</code> which runs
              <code>vim/vscode-neovim.vim</code> (<a href="https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim/blob/master/vim/vscode-neovim.vim">linky</a>)
              before running your <code>init.vim</code> file. This script is what sets
              up the <code>g:vscode</code> flag and sources all the other
              <code>vscode-*.vim</code> scripts except
              <code>vscode-options.vim</code>. The latter runs <em>after</em> your
              <code>init.vim</code> in order to force some settings that would
              otherwise break the extension or cause Neovim to be confused.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>So far this is pretty standard fare for how Neovim would be embedded
          for a custom UI. But things get a bit interesting from the next
          step.</p>
        <ol start="2" type="1">
          <li>
            <p><strong>Creates a new Neovim buffer and window corresponding to a
VSCode editor.</strong></p>
            <p>The buffer thus created is a plain text buffer without any bells or
              whistles. Contents of the buffer comes from VSCode<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.
              VSCodeNeovim synchronizes the content between the Neovim buffer and the
              VSCode editor. Thus the relationship between the contents and the
              corresponding file on disk is mediated through VSCode. This is a key
              difference between other custom UIs and this one and one that opens many
              possibilities.</p>
            <p>VSCodeNeovim defers to VSCode for handling insert mode. VSCode
              handles autocompletion and other assistive features. You’ll have to get
              used to your insert mode customizations not working, or replicating that
              with VSCode keyboard mapping customizations. When exiting insert mode
              the extension asynchronously synchronizes the buffer contents – which at
              this point would include the changes that were introduced – with Neovim.
              The code for synchronizing the VSCode editor contents and the Neovim
              buffer is in <code>buffer_manager.ts</code> (<a href="https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim/blob/master/src/buffer_manager.ts">linky</a>)
              which is also a good place to look if you want to know the details about
              buffer options that are being set.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Of course I’m eliding lots of detail here including integrations for
          other areas of UI. But I think this captures the pertinent details. The
          extension is a pretty impressive piece of work which is well worth a
          gander. Now on to the good stuff.</p>
        <h2 id="responsive-neovim-experience-over-a-laggy-ssh-connection">Responsive
          Neovim Experience Over A laggy SSH Connection</h2>
        <p>This gets to the reason why I’m trying to move to VSCode in the first
          place. I work on a project consisting of thousands of C++ source files.
          My home-office doesn’t have enough hardware to do regular builds, or in
          fact any build at all. The beefy machines are in a remote location
          accessible via SSH.</p>
        <p>I’ve been using Neovim over SSH for a while, but the latency really
          bothers me. And no, neither SCP nor SSHFS scratches this itch because I
          won’t have access to language smarts like <code>clangd</code> which
          require access to all the source files and some build tooling.</p>
        <p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview">VSCode
            Remote Development</a> was a nearly perfect answer with the exception
          that VSCodeVim didn’t quite have all the functionality I needed.
          VSCodeNeovim addresses that last piece of the puzzle.</p>
        <p>VSCode + Remote SSH + VSCodeNeovim + Neovim gives me:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./architecture.png" alt="Architecture of VSCode + Remote SSH + VSCodeNeovim + Neovim">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Architecture of VSCode + Remote SSH +
            VSCodeNeovim + Neovim</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <ul>
          <li>On the remote machine:
            <ul>
              <li>Source files.</li>
              <li>Build tooling.</li>
              <li><code>clangd</code> process invoked via
                <code>vscode-remote</code>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>On the local machine:
            <ul>
              <li>VSCode.</li>
              <li>VSCodeNeovim.
                <ul>
                  <li>Neovim instance embedded by VSCodeNeovim.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Neovim plug-ins and normal mode keybindings.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since the embedded Neovim instance is local the editors are super
          responsive. Completions via <code>clangd</code> is still laggy as one
          might expect. But that’s something I’m willing to live with.</p>
        <h2 id="proportional-fonts-with-neovim">Proportional Fonts With
          Neovim</h2>
        <p>Okay, so why would anyone actually want this? Turns out <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=proportional+fonts+for+coding">I’m
            not the only one</a>. In my case I prefer monospace for regular code,
          but I’d much much rather read comments and prose in proportional font.
          Also, I now spend a lot of my time writing Markdown with LatexMath.
          Staring at monospaced prose all day is not my cup of tea.</p>
        <p>This is what it looks like when I’m editing this post in VSCode (in
          Markdown).</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./proportional-font-markdown.png" alt="Screenshot of VSCode editing Markdown in proportional font">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Screenshot of VSCode editing Markdown in
            proportional font</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The best part is that I can use my familiar Vim/Neovim keybindings
          and modal editing. I had to make a couple of customizations and I only
          have this set up for Markdown. But it works fairly well. One gotcha is
          that the cursor jumps horizontally when moving the cursor up or down
          since the columns are no longer neatly aligned.</p>
        <h3 id="monospace-code-with-proportional-comments">Monospace Code With
          Proportional Comments?</h3>
        <p>What I really want isn’t proportional fonts everywhere. Rather I only
          want proportional fonts for prose. In code, this would take the form of
          comments.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, VSCode doesn’t support changing the font for specific
          syntactic tokens or scopes. That would’ve been ideal because it would
          let me configure things so that comments are in proportional font while
          the rest is in monospace. Also in the case of Markdown, I’d be able to
          make everything proportional except for inline code and fenced code
          blocks. Alas we are not quite there yet. Several feature requests
          already exist<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, but hasn’t seen much activity.</p>
        <h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>VSCodeNeovim is a functional replacement for the avid Neovim or
            perhaps Vim user who wants it both ways. Lots of caveats exist including
            the fact that Neovim mode only really works inside editor windows.</li>
          <li>VSCodeNeovim + “Remote SSH” is an awesome combination for editing
            remote files using Neovim with the latency of a local Neovim
            instance.</li>
          <li>You can use proportional fonts with VSCodeNeovim for super double
            awesomeness.</li>
        </ol>

          <ol>
            <li id="fn1">
              <p>Not quite the whole story because it’s possible a buffer
                be created inside the Neovim instance and have it be mirrored in a
                VSCode editor. But that’s probably not what you’ll be using on a regular
                basis.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

              <p>A quick search in the VSCode repository <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/search?q=tokenColorCustomizations+font+name">with
                  this query</a> yields several issues that request for pretty much the
                same thing: Allow setting <code>fontName</code> in
                <code>tokenColorCustomizations</code>. There’s also <a href="https://github.com/deepanrajkumar/Italic-and-Ligature">this
                  curious experiment</a> which patches in a different font for italics so
                that you can use the existing <code>fontStyle: "italic"</code> option in
