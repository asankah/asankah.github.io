        <p>This blog is authored in the form of Markdown files which are then
          used to produce a set of static HTML files and their dependencies.</p>
        <p>Previously the <a href="../how-this-blog-works/">static site
            generator I used</a> was <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. This
          arrangement worked for a while but it had some shortcomings.</p>
        <h2 id="growing-pains">Growing Pains</h2>
        <h3 id="hugos-support-for-pandoc-was-coming-short">Hugo’s Support for
          Pandoc Was Coming Short</h3>
        <p>I was using <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> to convert
          Markdown to HTML. Hugo’s support for Pandoc had some limitations. For
          example, you can’t specify options for Pandoc or configure anything
          about it. Pandoc has some amazing features, but to use them you have to
          – mostly – use command-line options. One feature I used frequently was
          to use Lua for generating diagrams. When I moved the blog to Hugo, that
          stopped working.</p>
        <p>So obviously I tried to fix it by authoring a <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/7529">patch that added
            support for configuring Pandoc</a>. Some of the ways in which Pandoc can
          be configured can be a bit risky. For example, a blog template might
          include some frontmatter that causes Pandoc to run some unexpected
          binary. That’s not great. While tinkering on this was fun, it created an
          additional headache. Namely, whenever and whereever I wanted to build my
          blog, I had to maintain a custom build of Hugo. After moving my build a
          couple of times, maintaining a custom build became a painful chore.</p>
        <h3 id="the-blog-was-already-using-node">The Blog Was Already Using
          Node</h3>
        <p>Building the blog already needed Node. This was partly because of
          dependencies like Katex, but also because Hugo relied on Node hosted
          tools for post-processing the HTML and CSS. If I’m already paying the
          Node tax, why do I need to manually maintain a Hugo build? This no
          longer made sense.</p>
        <h2 id="the-exodus">The Exodus</h2>
        <p>So started the process of looking for an easy-to-use static site
          generator (SSG). My requirements were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The SSG should support building a blog using Markdown.</li>
          <li>The flavor of Markdown used should support some of the Pandoc
            features I was using, or at least have the flexibility to extend support
            for those features.</li>
          <li>Not require any custom patches in order to fulfill the previous two
            requirements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Eleventy was <em>almost</em> a no-brainer. People had high praise for
          it, including devrel folks at Google. So I felt like that would be an
          easy move.</p>
        <p>Eleventy’s Mardown support is based on Mardown-It – which is itself
          fairly extensible. One thing that I liked about Markdown-It from the
          start is that there appeared to be people who are extending it to
          support various features of Pandoc. In fact I found plugins for
          basically all Pandoc features that I used in this blog. Everything was
          looking quite rosy indeed.</p>
        <p>Then I started using it. Then things started going wrong.</p>
        <h2 id="the-pain">The Pain</h2>
        <h3 id="webc-is-broken">WebC Is Broken</h3>
        <p>When I saw that Eleventy supported a templating language called <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/">WebC</a>, I was
          immediately drawn to it. I’ve already conceded that I’m going to have to
          rewrite all the templates. But I’ve kept things simple so for – as far
          as layouts go – so that wasn’t a huge lift.</p>
