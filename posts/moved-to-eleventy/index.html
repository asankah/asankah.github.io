        <p>Astute observers of this blog may have noticed that the blog looks
          suspiciously different lately. That’s because I changed the static site
          generator I was using.</p>
        <p>Previously the <a href="../how-this-blog-works/">static site
            generator I used</a> was <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. This
          arrangement worked for a while but it had some shortcomings.</p>
        <h2 id="growing-pains">Growing Pains</h2>
        <p>I was using <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> to convert
          Markdown to HTML. Hugo’s support for Pandoc had some limitations. For
          example, you can’t specify options for Pandoc or use a bibliography.
          When I moved the blog to Hugo, I lost some of these features. Attempting
          to close the gap I authored a <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/7529">patch that added
            support for configuring Pandoc</a>.</p>
        <p>Pandoc is extensible via filtering the AST of a document through a
          series of programs which can modify it. There is no restrction on the
          kinds of programs that you can use.</p>
        <p>If Hugo allowed configuring all this via frontmatter, that may
          introduce some tricky security issues.</p>
        <p>Say you download a Hugo theme from the web and try to build your
          site. A theme could include frontmatter that causes Pandoc to run an
          unsafe binary. That’s not great. So it is understandable that this kind
          of feature isn’t a part of Hugo proper<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.
          While my patch worked, it was safe only because I controlled every
          aspect of the blog.</p>
        <p>While tinkering on this was fun, it created an additional headache.
          Namely, whenever and whereever I wanted to build my blog, I had to
          maintain a custom build of Hugo. After moving my build a couple of times
          maintaining a custom build became a painful chore.</p>
        <h2 id="the-exodus">The Exodus</h2>
        <p>So started the process of looking for an easy-to-use static site
          generator (hereafter SSG). My requirements were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The SSG should support Markdown.</li>
          <li>Markdown should support some of the Pandoc features I was using, or
            at least have the flexibility to extend support for those features.</li>
          <li>Making this work should not require any custom patches.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> was <em>almost</em> a
          no-brainer. People had high praise for it, including developer relations
          folks at Google. So I felt like that would be an easy move.</p>
        <p>Eleventy’s Mardown support is based on <a href="https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it">Mardown-It</a>. One
          thing that I liked about Markdown-It from the start is that there
          appeared to be people who are extending it to support various features
          of Pandoc. In fact I found plugins for basically all Pandoc features
          that I used in this blog. Everything was looking quite rosy.</p>
        <h2 id="templating">Templating</h2>
        <h3 id="webc-eleventy-is-broken">WebC + Eleventy Is Broken</h3>
        <p>Eleventy supports a templating language called <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/">WebC</a>. It follows
          the web-component way of defining layouts, but can avoid much of the
          custom element overhead by opportunistically generating plain HTML. I
          had already accepted that switching the SSG meant rewriting layout
          templates, and using web components to do that seemed like a good idea<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
        <p>A couple of standalone WebC based templates worked fine. But the
          moment I had nested templates, Eleventy hung and eventually crashed. I
          didn’t want to go on a side quest to debug it, and ultimately that
          would’ve likely led to be violating the “no local patches” rule. So that
          was that for WebC. If WebC was more robust or just worked, it would have
          been my choice of template engine.</p>
        <p>One cool feature of using WebC with Eleventy is that bundling works
          trivially. For example, if you have a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag or
          a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag in a component, WebC automatically
          pulls the content into the relevant bundles. All other templating
          engines supported in Eleventy (save for third-party engines that I
          didn’t try) require manual labor to get stuff into the bundles.</p>
        <h3 id="nunjucks-eleventy-works">Nunjucks + Eleventy Works</h3>
        <p>The next templating language I looked at was Nunjucks. I had briefly
          looked at Liquid as well, but for my purposes Nunjucks and Liquid seemed
          to be quite similar. Nunjucks won out because it had safer defaults<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
        <h2 id="handrolling">Handrolling</h2>
        <h3 id="pandoc-again">Pandoc Again</h3>
        <p>I tried to rely only on Markdown-It for this blog. But very soon I
          had a big stack of extensions to support the various features I needed,
          like supporting <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s, bibliography, and attributes.
          While the Markdown-It ecosystem is extensive, it also introduces a lot
          of confusion. For example, there are multiple packages that all provide
          the same functionality and <em>also based on the same base package</em>.
          Keeping track of all this was starting to be a pain. Also, I had trouble
          getting block level containers working.</p>
        <p>After a while I decided not to waste time trying to replicate
          features that already existed in Pandoc. So I wrote a little library
          that invoked Pandoc within Eleventy to convert Markdown to HTML. It was
          a little slower, but worked out great.</p>
        <h3 id="bundling-files">Bundling Files</h3>
        <p>While it is possible to add content to bundles (like CSS and JS),
          curiously it was not possible to stuff files into said bundles. The
          suggested method was to do something like this:</p>
        <pre><code>  {% css %}
    {% include &quot;some-file.css&quot; %}
    body {
        // other CSS.
    }
  {% endcss %}</code></pre>
        <p>This seems like a good idea, but there is one crucial issue: <em>The
contents of the included file (<code>some-file.css</code> in the example
above) is also processed by the same templating engine</em>. If the file
          doesn’t contain any sequences that look like template tokens, then we
          are good. But this is asking for trouble.</p>
        <p>So I wrote a custom tag called <code>bundleFile</code> that can take
          the contents of a file and stuff it directly into a bundle. The earlier
          example now looks like this:</p>
        <pre><code>  {% bundleFile &quot;some-file.css&quot; %}
  {% css %}
    body {
        // other CSS
    }
  {% endcss %}</code></pre>
        <h3 id="sassy">SASSy</h3>
        <p>Eleventy doesn’t support SASS out of the box, but there are examples
          in the documentation for how you can set it up. But all of the examples
          assume that you have SASS or SCSS files that you are going to conver to
          CSS, and then serve without bundling. I wanted to be able to compile
          SASS and stuff the resulting CSS into a bundle.</p>
        <p>So alongside the <code>bundleFile</code> shortcode, I added a
          <code>bundleScss</code> shortcode so I can do stuff like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>   {% bundleScss &quot;my-styles.scss&quot; %}</code></pre>
        <h3 id="katex">Katex</h3>
        <p>I like Katex for my math typesetting. Pandoc supports it out of the
          box. But the rendered HTML needs to invoke Katex in the client to render
          the math. I wanted to avoid this step entirely and try to render Katex
          on the server.</p>
        <p>This was a pain to do with Hugo, but since Eleventy was alredy runing
          in Node, server-side rendering is a breeze.</p>
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Overall I found Eleventy fun to work with. My gripes are mostly with
          the documentation which lacks a reference. It’s a pain to go through
          tutorial-like documents to find out what exactly gets passed to a
          shortcode or what to do when a shortcode adds a dependency. I made way
          too many trips to the 11ty GitHub repo. The right number of required
          visits should be zero.</p>
        <p>In the coming weeks I’ll package Eleventy Pandoc support and some of
          the shortcodes so others can use them.</p>

              <p>There are ways to mitigate this problem. For example, we
                could restrict which flags can be inherited from themes, or require that
                certain options can only be set from the top level
                <code>hugo.yaml</code> file that the user controls.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

                <code>foo</code> would be inserted into the document. Nunjucks will
                treat the contents as unsafe and requires manually opting into unsafe
                injection via <code>{{ foo | safe }}</code>. Liquid will insert the
                contents with no escaping.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>
