It’s a fact of life for large organizations. A popular metaphor making the rounds now is this concept of pillars. The metaphor makes sense to some extent.

To quote from the Philosophy:
Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.
This particular aspect of the format wasn’t maintained very well. Immediately following the “Philosophy” section is “Inline HTML” which contradicts the “without looking like it’s been marked up” requirement.</description></item><item><title>On Gender Gap in Adolescent Mental Health</title><link>https://xn--izc.com/posts/gender-gap-in-adolescent-mental-health/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 14:51:34 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://xn--izc.com/posts/gender-gap-in-adolescent-mental-health/</guid><description>A recent study found that more gender-equal countries have larger

I’ve also served in numerous hiring committees over the years.
Tech companies tend to have cultures built around tech people interviewing other tech people, typically in what is not-so-affectionately known as the “Tech interview.” This is good because candidates would be evaluated based on their actual skills instead of keywords in their resume. Interviewers are in effect choosing their future coworkers which makes in interview serve the interest of both the interviewer and the interviewee.</description></item><item><title>On WontFixing Bugs</title><link>https://xn--izc.com/posts/on-wontfixing-bugs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 17:15:06 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://xn--izc.com/posts/on-wontfixing-bugs/</guid><description>&lt;p>Large projects accumulate a large number of issue reports over time.

A little bit of research1 tells us that the distribution was originally introduced by Abraham de Moivre in 1710 in an article called “On the Measurement of Chance, or, on the Probability of Events in Games Depending Upon Fortuitous Chance” 2 (not the original title).
A few steps that will get us there is laid out below.

snake_case, hacker_case, unix_hacker_style : Everything is lower case, though exceptions exist. E.g. HTTP_foo_bar. SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE : Usually reserved for macros and constants. camelCase : The first letter is lowercase. PascalCase : The first letter is uppercase. kabob-case : Like snake_case, but uses dashes instead of underscores. Common for command-line options1, CSS styles, commands (e.g. git-receive-pack).

Say you have a several windows open in Vim and you want to edit another file. Using :edit works if you want to open the file in the current window unconditionally.
But that’s often not what you want. If you have the same file open in another window, then the most efficient and least disruptive thing to do is to switch to that window.</description></item><item><title>Notes from Crash Course's Videos on Fact Checking Information You See On The Internet</title><link>https://xn--izc.com/posts/notes-on-fact-checking/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jul 2020 18:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://xn--izc.com/posts/notes-on-fact-checking/</guid><description>Hank Green’s Crash Course YouTube channel has an excellent series
