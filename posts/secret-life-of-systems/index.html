          Software systems aim to solve real world problems. They implement some
          behavior that the authors of the system believe would address the
          problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          For non-trivial systems the coupling is imperfect between the real
          world problem, the problem as understood by some group of people, the
          perceived solution, the solution as it is actually implemented, and
          the solution as received by the users.
        </p>
        <p>The diagram below illustrates this phenomenon.</p>

          >
          system life-cycle begins – as most things do – in the real world.
        </p>
        <h3 id="the-problem-p">The Problem (P)</h3>
        <p>
          There is a problem that affects some group of people<a
            href="#fn2"
            class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref2"
            role="doc-noteref"
            ><sup>2</sup></a
          >. Let’s call it <strong>P</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know these problems exist by their symptoms. For example people
          might just feel something isn’t pretty great or that things could be
          better if only we could figure out how.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond that a precise and comprehensive definition of the problem
          doesn’t exist. This might seem like a strong claim, but it comes down
          to the fact that everything involving people is complicated.
        </p>
        <h3 id="the-model-m">The Model (M)</h3>
        <p>
          So people set out to understand the problem deeper. Experimentation,
          user studies, interviews, observations, are all things that we do to
          conjure these invisible problems into existence. We go probing for
          symptoms to understand what might be causing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on these we develop and a model of the problem. The model may be
          laid out for everone to see or it could be in someone’s head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s call this <strong>M</strong> for <em>model</em>. The model is
          the entirety of our <em>understanding</em> of the problem. It is a
          prerequisite before we can theorize about …
        </p>
        <h3 id="the-solution-s">The Solution (S)</h3>
        <p>
          At first the solutions are themselves models – things that work
          <em>in theory</em> when evaluated against the model
          <strong>M</strong>, but yet to be verified against the real world
          problem <strong>P</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The models of solutions – let’s call them <strong>S</strong> – are
          what we think will address what we assume is the problem. Depending on
          the level of rigor, we will draw little diagrams, write design
          documents, shop our ideas around, discuss alternatives, collaborate
          and refine these solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually or during this process we will put something together that
          works somewhat.
        </p>
        <h3 id="the-implementation-i">The Implementation (I)</h3>
        <p>
          So an implementation comes together – let’s call it
          <strong>I</strong>. The difference between <strong>S</strong> and
          <strong>I</strong> stems from practical matters. Time, resources,
          technical limitations, all affect how much of our model solution
          <strong>S</strong> we can implement. The result is often different
          from what we thought we would eventually have.
        </p>
        <h3 id="deployment-d">Deployment (D)</h3>
        <p>
          Whatever solution we put together is useless unless we take our
          masterpiece to those who are experiencing the problem – the users.
        </p>
        <p>
          The likelihood of a non-trivial solution reaching its entire intended
          audience is low. The implementation may not be received in the same
          spirit in which it was built.
        </p>
        <p>
          And often, this is the point at which we will find out how much our
          solution matches the needs of the real world.
        </p>
        <p>
          They way in which our implementation <strong>I</strong> interacts with
          the real world is – the deployment <strong>D</strong>.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Much like the subject at hand, systems lifecycles don’t follow neatly
          delineated phases as described. Real systems typically exist in all
          phases simultaneously. Understanding the question is a continuous
          process. Plans change all the time. As any engineer will tell you,
          what tools and resources are available are <em>also</em> part of the
          problem statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there are a few key observations that you can make from this
          model:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>We lose information at every phase</strong>. Our model of
              the real world problem is guaranteed to be of much lower fidelity
              than the real thing<a
                href="#fn3"
                class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref3"
                role="doc-noteref"
                ><sup>3</sup></a
              >. Our model solution is going to fall short of addressing our
              model solution. Our implementation will not match our aspirational
              solution. And whatever we manage to get in users hands isn’t quite
              working the way we thought it would.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Understanding the problem is a continuous process</strong
              >. Every phase of this lifecycle brings with it new insights into
              what it is we want to achieve and what we are working with. Each
              new insight changes our problem statement, solution, and
              eventually implementation and deployment.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Understanding the problem must be deliberate</strong>.
              Given that the deployed solution isn’t quite a match for the real
              world problem, we need to ensure that we have the right
              measurements and probes in place to understand this mismatch – be
              it telemetry, user satisfaction surveys, interviews, or whatever
              else.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Whenever we are holding some concept, being conscious about where in
          the lifecycle that thing fits helps us get a sense for the level of
          maturity of the concept and where you need to be to solve the problem.

                Problems that we are interested in are those that affect people.
                They tend to by squishy and ill-defined. Problems that are
                defined entirely in the theoretical relam don’t fall into the
                model that we are going to discuss. Theoretical subproblems like
                that are what we use to construct solutions for the evolving
                squishy problems that we are discussing here.<a

                In networking, adding too much buffering to intermediate network
                devices introduce unnecessary delays. The trade-off is that
                <em>bursty</em> traffic will have the appearance of getting
                through faster. But in reality, the speed of the network is
                still the same. Data just takes longer to get through.
