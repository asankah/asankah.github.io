        <p>Software systems aim to solve real world problems. They implement
          some behavior that the authors of the system believe would address the
          problem.</p>
        <p>For non-trivial systems the coupling is imperfect between the real
          world problem, the problem as understood by some group of people, the
          perceived solution, the solution as it is actually implemented, and the
          solution as received by the users.</p>
        <p>The diagram below illustrates this phenomenon.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./lifecycle.png" class="full-bleed" alt="Software systems lifecycle. (Described in prose below)">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Software systems lifecycle. (Described in
            prose below)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The software<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> system life-cycle begins – as most
          things do – in the real world.</p>
        <h4 id="the-problem-p">The Problem (P)</h4>
        <p>There is a problem that affects some group of people<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.
          Let’s call it <strong>P</strong>.</p>
        <p>We know these problems exist by their symptoms. For example people
          might just feel something isn’t pretty great or that things could be
          better if only we could figure out how.</p>
        <p>Beyond that a precise and comprehensive definition of the problem
          doesn’t exist. This might seem like a strong claim, but it comes down to
          the fact that everything involving people is complicated.</p>
        <h4 id="the-model-m">The Model (M)</h4>
        <p>So people set out to understand the problem deeper. Experimentation,
          user studies, interviews, observations, are all things that we do to
          conjure these invisible problems into existence. We go probing for
          symptoms to understand what might be causing them.</p>
        <p>Based on these we develop and a model of the problem. The model may
          be laid out for everone to see or it could be in someone’s head.</p>
        <p>Let’s call this <strong>M</strong> for <em>model</em>. The model is
          the entirety of our <em>understanding</em> of the problem. It is a
          prerequisite before we can theorize about …</p>
        <h4 id="the-solution-s">The Solution (S)</h4>
        <p>At first the solutions are themselves models – things that work
          <em>in theory</em> when evaluated against the model <strong>M</strong>,
          but yet to be verified against the real world problem
          <strong>P</strong>
        </p>
        <p>The models of solutions – let’s call them <strong>S</strong> – are
          what we think will address what we assume is the problem. Depending on
          the level of rigor, we will draw little diagrams, write design
          documents, shop our ideas around, discuss alternatives, collaborate and
          refine these solutions.</p>
        <p>Eventually or during this process we will put something together that
          works somewhat.</p>
        <h4 id="the-implementation-i">The Implementation (I)</h4>
        <p>So an implementation comes together – let’s call it
          <strong>I</strong>. The difference between <strong>S</strong> and
          <strong>I</strong> stems from practical matters. Time, resources,
          technical limitations, all affect how much of our model solution
          <strong>S</strong> we can implement. The result is often different from
          what we thought we would eventually have.
        </p>
        <h3 id="deployment-d">Deployment (D)</h3>
        <p>Whatever solution we put together is useless unless we take our
          masterpiece to those who are experiencing the problem – the users.</p>
        <p>The likelihood of a non-trivial solution reaching its entire intended
          audience is low. The implementation may not be received in the same
          spirit in which it was built.</p>
        <p>And often, this is the point at which we will find out how much our
          solution matches the needs of the real world.</p>
        <p>They way in which our implementation <strong>I</strong> interacts
          with the real world is – the deployment <strong>D</strong>.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Much like the subject at hand, systems lifecycles don’t follow neatly
          delineated phases as described. Real systems typically exist in all
          phases simultaneously. Understanding the question is a continuous
          process. Plans change all the time. As any engineer will tell you, what
          tools and resources are available are <em>also</em> part of the problem
          statement.</p>
        <p>But there are a few key observations that you can make from this
          model:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>We lose information at every phase</strong>. Our model of
              the real world problem is guaranteed to be of much lower fidelity than
              the real thing<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. Our model solution is going to fall
              short of addressing our model solution. Our implementation will not
              match our aspirational solution. And whatever we manage to get in users
              hands isn’t quite working the way we thought it would.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Understanding the problem is a continuous
process</strong>. Every phase of this lifecycle brings with it new
              insights into what it is we want to achieve and what we are working
              with. Each new insight changes our problem statement, solution, and
              eventually implementation and deployment.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Understanding the problem must be deliberate</strong>.
              Given that the deployed solution isn’t quite a match for the real world
              problem, we need to ensure that we have the right measurements and
              probes in place to understand this mismatch – be it telemetry, user
              satisfaction surveys, interviews, or whatever else.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Whenever we are holding some concept, being conscious about where in
          the lifecycle that thing fits helps us get a sense for the level of
          maturity of the concept and where you need to be to solve the
          problem.</p>

              <p>Problems that we are interested in are those that affect
                people. They tend to by squishy and ill-defined. Problems that are
                defined entirely in the theoretical relam don’t fall into the model that
                we are going to discuss. Theoretical subproblems like that are what we
                use to construct solutions for the evolving squishy problems that we are
