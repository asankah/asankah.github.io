some behavior that the authors of the system believe would address the
problem.</p><p>For non-trivial systems the coupling is imperfect between the real
world problem, the problem as understood by some group of people, the
perceived solution, the solution as it is actually implemented, and the
solution as received by the users.</p><p>The diagram below illustrates this phenomenon.</p><figure><img src=./lifecycle.png alt="Software systems lifecycle. (Described in prose below)"><figcaption aria-hidden=true>Software systems lifecycle. (Described in
prose below)</figcaption></figure><p>The software<a href=#fn1 class=footnote-ref id=fnref1 role=doc-noteref><sup>1</sup></a> system life-cycle begins – as most
things do – in the real world.</p><h4 id=the-problem-p>The Problem (P)</h4><p>There is a problem that affects some group of people<a href=#fn2 class=footnote-ref id=fnref2 role=doc-noteref><sup>2</sup></a>.
Let’s call it <strong>P</strong>.</p><p>We know these problems exist by their symptoms. For example people
might just feel something isn’t pretty great or that things could be
better if only we could figure out how.</p><p>Beyond that a precise and comprehensive definition of the problem
doesn’t exist. This might seem like a strong claim, but it comes down to
the fact that everything involving people is complicated.</p><h4 id=the-model-m>The Model (M)</h4><p>So people set out to understand the problem deeper. Experimentation,
user studies, interviews, observations, are all things that we do to
conjure these invisible problems into existence. We go probing for
symptoms to understand what might be causing them.</p><p>Based on these we develop and a model of the problem. The model may
be laid out for everone to see or it could be in someone’s head.</p><p>Let’s call this <strong>M</strong> for <em>model</em>. The model is
the entirety of our <em>understanding</em> of the problem. It is a
prerequisite before we can theorize about …</p><h4 id=the-solution-s>The Solution (S)</h4><p>At first the solutions are themselves models – things that work
<em>in theory</em> when evaluated against the model <strong>M</strong>,
but yet to be verified against the real world problem
<strong>P</strong></p><p>The models of solutions – let’s call them <strong>S</strong> – are
what we think will address what we assume is the problem. Depending on
the level of rigor, we will draw little diagrams, write design
documents, shop our ideas around, discuss alternatives, collaborate and
refine these solutions.</p><p>Eventually or during this process we will put something together that
works somewhat.</p><h4 id=the-implementation-i>The Implementation (I)</h4><p>So an implementation comes together – let’s call it
<strong>I</strong>. The difference between <strong>S</strong> and
<strong>I</strong> stems from practical matters. Time, resources,
technical limitations, all affect how much of our model solution
<strong>S</strong> we can implement. The result is often different from
what we thought we would eventually have.</p><h3 id=deployment-d>Deployment (D)</h3><p>Whatever solution we put together is useless unless we take our
masterpiece to those who are experiencing the problem – the users.</p><p>The likelihood of a non-trivial solution reaching its entire intended
audience is low. The implementation may not be received in the same
spirit in which it was built.</p><p>And often, this is the point at which we will find out how much our
solution matches the needs of the real world.</p><p>They way in which our implementation <strong>I</strong> interacts
with the real world is – the deployment <strong>D</strong>.</p><hr><p>Much like the subject at hand, systems lifecycles don’t follow neatly
delineated phases as described. Real systems typically exist in all
phases simultaneously. Understanding the question is a continuous
process. Plans change all the time. As any engineer will tell you, what
tools and resources are available are <em>also</em> part of the problem
statement.</p><p>But there are a few key observations that you can make from this
model:</p><ul><li><p><strong>We lose information at every phase</strong>. Our model of
the real world problem is guaranteed to be of much lower fidelity than
the real thing<a href=#fn3 class=footnote-ref id=fnref3 role=doc-noteref><sup>3</sup></a>. Our model solution is going to fall
short of addressing our model solution. Our implementation will not
match our aspirational solution. And whatever we manage to get in users
hands isn’t quite working the way we thought it would.</p></li><li><p><strong>Understanding the problem is a continuous
process</strong>. Every phase of this lifecycle brings with it new
insights into what it is we want to achieve and what we are working
with. Each new insight changes our problem statement, solution, and
eventually implementation and deployment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Understanding the problem must be deliberate</strong>.
Given that the deployed solution isn’t quite a match for the real world
problem, we need to ensure that we have the right measurements and
probes in place to understand this mismatch – be it telemetry, user
satisfaction surveys, interviews, or whatever else.</p></li></ul><p>Whenever we are holding some concept, being conscious about where in
the lifecycle that thing fits helps us get a sense for the level of
maturity of the concept and where you need to be to solve the
problem.</p><aside id=footnotes class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document" role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn1><p>The concept applies equally to non-software systems – as
long as they aim to solve real world problems.<a href=#fnref1 class=footnote-back role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a></p></li><li id=fn2><p>Problems that we are interested in are those that affect
people. They tend to by squishy and ill-defined. Problems that are
defined entirely in the theoretical relam don’t fall into the model that
we are going to discuss. Theoretical subproblems like that are what we
use to construct solutions for the evolving squishy problems that we are
discussing here.<a href=#fnref2 class=footnote-back role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a></p></li><li id=fn3><p>… which is why it is called a “model”.<a href=#fnref3 class=footnote-back role=doc-backlink>↩︎</a></p></li></ol></aside></div><div class=pagination><a href=/posts/why-i-hate-carousels/ class="left arrow">&#8592;</a>
