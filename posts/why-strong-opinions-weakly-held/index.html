        <h2 id="origins-of-the-phrase">Origins of the phrase</h2>
        <p>The title of this blog is <strong>Strong Opinions, Weakly
Held</strong>. The same concept shows up elsewhere are <em>Strong
Opinions Loosely Held</em>. An eponymous essay by Paul Saffo in <span class="citation" data-cites="Saffo"><a href="#ref-Saffo" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span> introduced the world to this
          concept.</p>
        <p>In his essay – which isn’t very long if you would like to <a href="https://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/">read
            the whole thing yourself</a> – he lays out the concept as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>I have found that the fastest way to an effective forecast is often
            through a sequence of lousy forecasts. Instead of withholding judgment
            until an exhaustive search for data is complete, I will force myself to
            make a tentative forecast based on the information available, and then
            systematically tear it apart, using the insights gained to guide my
            search for further indicators and information.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>
        <p>Cedric Chin’s critique <span class="citation" data-cites="Cedric"><a href="#ref-Cedric" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></span> comes down to two
          points that the author summarizes as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>In my experience, ‘strong opinions, weakly held’ is difficult to put
            into practice. Most people who try will either:</p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Use it as downside-protection to justify their strongly-held bad
              opinions, or</li>
            <li>Struggle to shift from one strong opinion to another.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The reason it is difficult is because it works against the grain of
            the human mind.</p>
          <p>So don’t bother. The next time you find yourself making a judgment,
            don’t invoke ‘strong opinions, weakly held’. Instead, ask: “how much are
            you willing to bet on that?” Doing so will jolt people into the types of
            thinking you want to encourage.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Michael Natkin on <span class="citation" data-cites="Michael"><a href="#ref-Michael" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></span> points out the
          fallacy of assuming that strong opinions will be reliably
          challenged:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The idea of strong opinions, loosely held is that you can make
            bombastic statements, and everyone should implicitly assume that you’ll
            happily change your mind in a heartbeat if new data suggests you are
            wrong. It is supposed to lead to a collegial, competitive environment in
            which ideas get a vigorous defense, the best of them survive, and no-one
            gets their feelings hurt in the process.</p>
          <p>[…]</p>
          <p>What really happens? The loudest, most bombastic engineer states
            their case with certainty, and that shuts down discussion. Other people
            either assume the loudmouth knows best, or don’t want to stick out their
            neck and risk criticism and shame. This is especially true if the
            loudmouth is senior, or there is any other power differential.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2 id="reconciliation">Reconciliation</h2>
        <p>Both cases above illustrate the damage caused by the disconnect
          between the holder of the opinion and others about the degree of
          confidence with which the opinion is held. A strongly held – and thusly
          communicated – opinion has a higher chance of being misinterpreted as
          conviction.</p>
        <p>Saffo’s original claim still holds that having a potentially
          inaccurate position is <em>better than having none at all</em>. Such a
          position elicits arguments and opens up avenues for investigation that
          wouldn’t otherwise materialize in the absence of any other catalyst.</p>
        <p>Cedric Chin’s essay points out a simple fix, where the holder of the
          opinion also states the degree of confidence. This is meant to dress up
          the opinion more as a target than a decree, thus inviting debate instead
          of suppressing. I believe this to be good advice.</p>
        <p>Back in my college days, I remember a particularly engaging professor
          asking a question like “is claim <em>A</em> true or is claim <em>B</em>
          true?” After observing a lackluster show of hands he remarked that of
          the three groups of students – those that chose <em>A</em>, those that
          chose <em>B</em>, and those that chose neither – the group that will
          leave the lecture having learned the most is the group that gets the
          answer wrong. He advised all of us to “get some skin in the game,” even
          if you don’t know the answer.</p>
        <p>There is some truth to this. Of course a corporate meeting where we
          need to elicit debate from a group of people with varying levels of
          confidence is a very different venue than a group of students answering
          a question. But a similar principle still applies. The goals might be
          different, but it’s still better to cajole everyone to get some skin in
          the game instead of not passive silence.</p>
        <h2 id="what-strong-opinions-weakly-held-means-to-me">What ‘Strong
          Opinions Weakly Held’ Means To Me</h2>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>Having an opinion is better than not having one. Accmulation of
              raw data is great, but it’s even better when you intentionally accrete
              them into something meaningful. Any interpretation of information beyond
              establishment of fact is probably going to be in the realm of
              opinion.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>An opinion expressed is better than one that is not as long as
              it’s open for criticism. You wouldn’t find out if you were wrong if you
              didn’t tell anyone.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>That it is weakly held is as important to communicate as the
              opinion itself. Doing so invites criticism and discussion instead of
              suppressing them.</p>
