        <p>
          The title of this blog is
          <strong>Strong Opinions, Weakly Held</strong>. The same concept shows
          up elsewhere are <em>Strong Opinions Loosely Held</em>. An eponymous
          essay by Paul Saffo in
          <span class="citation" data-cites="Saffo"
            >(<a href="#ref-Saffo" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span
          >
          introduced the world to this concept.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his essay – which isn’t very long if you would like to
          <a
            href="https://www.saffo.com/02008/07/26/strong-opinions-weakly-held/"
            >read the whole thing yourself</a
          >
          – he lays out the concept as follows:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            I have found that the fastest way to an effective forecast is often
            through a sequence of lousy forecasts. Instead of withholding
            judgment until an exhaustive search for data is complete, I will
            force myself to make a tentative forecast based on the information
            available, and then systematically tear it apart, using the insights
            gained to guide my search for further indicators and information.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>
        <p>
          Cedric Chin’s critique
          <span class="citation" data-cites="Cedric"
            >(<a href="#ref-Cedric" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span
          >
          comes down to two points that the author summarizes as follows:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <p>
            In my experience, ‘strong opinions, weakly held’ is difficult to put
            into practice. Most people who try will either:
          </p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              Use it as downside-protection to justify their strongly-held bad
              opinions, or
            </li>
            <li>Struggle to shift from one strong opinion to another.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The reason it is difficult is because it works against the grain of
            the human mind.
          </p>
          <figcaption>
            <p>
              So don’t bother. The next time you find yourself making a
              judgment, don’t invoke ‘strong opinions, weakly held’. Instead,
              ask: “how much are you willing to bet on that?” Doing so will jolt
              people into the types of thinking you want to encourage.
            </p>

          <span class="citation" data-cites="Michael"
            >(<a href="#ref-Michael" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span
          >
          points out the fallacy of assuming that strong opinions will be
          reliably challenged:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <p>
            The idea of strong opinions, loosely held is that you can make
            bombastic statements, and everyone should implicitly assume that
            you’ll happily change your mind in a heartbeat if new data suggests
            you are wrong. It is supposed to lead to a collegial, competitive
            environment in which ideas get a vigorous defense, the best of them
            survive, and no-one gets their feelings hurt in the process.
          </p>
          <p>[…]</p>
          <figcaption>
            <p>
              What really happens? The loudest, most bombastic engineer states
              their case with certainty, and that shuts down discussion. Other
              people either assume the loudmouth knows best, or don’t want to
              stick out their neck and risk criticism and shame. This is
              especially true if the loudmouth is senior, or there is any other
              power differential.
            </p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2 id="reconciliation">Reconciliation</h2>
        <p>
          Both cases above illustrate the damage caused by the disconnect
          between the holder of the opinion and others about the degree of
          confidence with which the opinion is held. A strongly held – and
          thusly communicated – opinion has a higher chance of being
          misinterpreted as conviction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Saffo’s original claim still holds that having a potentially
          inaccurate position is <em>better than having none at all</em>. Such a
          position elicits arguments and opens up avenues for investigation that
          wouldn’t otherwise materialize in the absence of any other catalyst.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cedric Chin’s essay points out a simple fix, where the holder of the
          opinion also states the degree of confidence. This is meant to dress
          up the opinion more as a target than a decree, thus inviting debate
          instead of suppressing. I believe this to be good advice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back in my college days, I remember a particularly engaging professor
          asking a question like “is claim <em>A</em> true or is claim
          <em>B</em> true?” After observing a lackluster show of hands he
          remarked that of the three groups of students – those that chose
          <em>A</em>, those that chose <em>B</em>, and those that chose neither
          – the group that will leave the lecture having learned the most is the
          group that gets the answer wrong. He advised all of us to “get some
          skin in the game,” even if you don’t know the answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is some truth to this. Of course a corporate meeting where we
          need to elicit debate from a group of people with varying levels of
          confidence is a very different venue than a group of students
          answering a question. But a similar principle still applies. The goals
          might be different, but it’s still better to cajole everyone to get
          some skin in the game instead of not passive silence.
        </p>

          What ‘Strong Opinions Weakly Held’ Means To Me
        </h2>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
              Having an opinion is better than not having one. Accmulation of
              raw data is great, but it’s even better when you intentionally
              accrete them into something meaningful. Any interpretation of
              information beyond establishment of fact is probably going to be
              in the realm of opinion.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              An opinion expressed is better than one that is not as long as
              it’s open for criticism. You wouldn’t find out if you were wrong
              if you didn’t tell anyone.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              That it is weakly held is as important to communicate as the
              opinion itself. Doing so invites criticism and discussion instead
              of suppressing them.
            </p>

                  Leadership is fallible and imperfect. Soft roles emerge as
                  they are needed to account for various team roles that are
                  needed but not formally defined. Some of these roles help
                  teams function, and some others act as crossbeams that hold an
                  entire organization together.

                  Develop an intuition for Shannon entropy as a measure of
                  information content. Using the game 'Guess Who' as a practical
                  example, this post explains how entropy quantifies the
                  reduction in ambiguity and builds up the mathematical
                  formulation from basic principles.
