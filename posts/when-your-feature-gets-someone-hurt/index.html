ruins. (Generated with Gemini)</figcaption></figure><p>A story making the rounds recently opened some disturbing
implications. The New York Times ran the story as <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/technology/israel-facial-recognition-gaza.html>Israel
Deploys Expansive Facial Recognition Program in Gaza</a> which says in
part:</p><blockquote><p>To supplement Corsight’s technology, Israeli officers used Google
Photos, the free photo sharing and storage service from Google, three
intelligence officers said. By uploading a database of known persons to
Google Photos, Israeli officers could use the service’s photo search
function to identify people.</p></blockquote><p>Whether this particular use of Google Photos is compliant with the
usage policy is irrelevant. Those are concerns for PR firms and lawyers.
Google Photos is a consumer product. People use it for tagging their
family and friends in their vacation photos. The product works pretty
well for this purpose.</p><p>The humanity behind the product developers and those who are
unexpectedly and unwittingly blindfolded and led away to some unkonwn
prison somewhere is an entirely different matter.</p><p>The intended usage of a product – especially software products –
matters greatly. People responsible for these features decide its fit
for purpose based on this intended usage. From their point of view, a
mislabelled photo is an inconvenience; possibly a funny one. The error
thresholds were never decided based on whether someone could lose their
life for it.</p><p>Some developer wrote a conditional branch without giving it a second
thought. And now it decides the fate of a human life. That’s quite the
turn of events.</p><p>There’s no moral here. People are going to use your products in ways
that you never intended. I bet the people who designed coins have no
idea the extents to which those coins were flipped for. And so it
goes.</p></div><div class=pagination><a href=/posts/secret-life-of-systems/ class="left arrow">&#8592;</a>
