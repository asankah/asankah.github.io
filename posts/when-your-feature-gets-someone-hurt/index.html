        <p>A story making the rounds recently opened some disturbing
          implications. The New York Times ran the story as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/technology/israel-facial-recognition-gaza.html">Israel
            Deploys Expansive Facial Recognition Program in Gaza</a> which says in
          part:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>To supplement Corsight’s technology, Israeli officers used Google
            Photos, the free photo sharing and storage service from Google, three
            intelligence officers said. By uploading a database of known persons to
            Google Photos, Israeli officers could use the service’s photo search
            function to identify people.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Whether this particular use of Google Photos is compliant with the
          usage policy is irrelevant. Those are concerns for PR firms and lawyers.
          Google Photos is a consumer product. People use it for tagging their
          family and friends in their vacation photos. The product works pretty
          well for this purpose.</p>
        <p>The humanity behind the product developers and those who are
          unexpectedly and unwittingly blindfolded and led away to some unkonwn
          prison somewhere is an entirely different matter.</p>
        <p>The intended usage of a product – especially software products –
          matters greatly. People responsible for these features decide its fit
          for purpose based on this intended usage. From their point of view, a
          mislabelled photo is an inconvenience; possibly a funny one. The error
          thresholds were never decided based on whether someone could lose their
          life for it.</p>
        <p>Some developer wrote a conditional branch without giving it a second
          thought. And now it decides the fate of a human life. That’s quite the
          turn of events.</p>
        <p>There’s no moral here. People are going to use your products in ways
          that you never intended. I bet the people who designed coins have no
          idea the extents to which those coins were flipped for. And so it
          goes.</p>
