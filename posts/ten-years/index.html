        <p>It’s been ten years since I started at Google. The work anniversary
          fell on 6th of December.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago my wife and I made our way to Mountain View for my
          orientation; all excited for a brand new chapter in our lives. After
          spending a week in Mountain View / Palo Alto we both decided that
          California was not for us. But that’s beside the point.</p>
        <p>I was elated. This was pretty much everything I dreamt of as a kid
          growing up in Sri Lanka. Except those days we dreamt of someday working
          for Microsoft or starting our own software company.</p>
        <p>One afternoon during orientation – maybe it was the evening, I don’t
          remember – I was walking by a bunch of outdoor tables next to one of the
          larger café’s at the Google HQ. As I walked by I overheard a Googler on
          the phone telling someone how they just had a really shitty day. I
          remember being confused. How could someone have a bad day at Google?
          Inconceivable.</p>
        <p>Obviously this feeling didn’t last. People normalize things quickly.
          The problem with achieving your dreams is that now you have to make
          more; an eternal treadmill. It’s nice to periodically look back though.
          The novelty isn’t there anymore, but it’s humbling to recall how much we
          dreamt for the things that we now take for granted.</p>
        <p>Looking back at the last years, the things that I’m really proud of
          aren’t my code contributions. If any aren’t already obsolete then by now
          it’s become some legacy crap that some engineer has to maintain.</p>
        <p>But the things that I really remember are the three times I talked
          hiring committees into hiring someone they had decided not to hire.
          Those were good candidates whom I thought didn’t get a fair shake.</p>
        <p>Also I clearly remember the smart people who acknowledged and
          appreciated my work. I also remember the ones that took credit for my
          work or didn’t treat me with dignity, but I don’t think about them that
          often.</p>
        <p>I remember the big projects that I initiated, the big ideas I sold,
          and the ones I managed to pull off.</p>
        <p>Then there are the low points. Moments when I let people down or
          burned a bridge or two for the wrong reasons.</p>
        <p>But overall, looking back there isn’t much there. It’s surprising how
          little really matters in the long run.</p>
        <p>I should remember that the next time I feel like staying up late
          trying to get something done because I feel some sort of obligation or
          bigger purpose in doing it. Often there is none.</p>
