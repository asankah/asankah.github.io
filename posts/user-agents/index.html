            The User-Agent, a technical name for the web browser, was supposed
            to be our loyal butler on the internet – doing our bidding and
            keeping us safe. But over decades, browser makers diluted its role,
            sometimes as a result of actions done with the best of intentions.
            Both the internet and browsers have become increasingly complex. And
            with that complexity, the custodianship of the users’ data has
            become murkier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite being the one peddling our data, user-agents can no longer
            tell us exactly who knows what about us. We’ve lost our agency over
            our browsing data. And now our dude on the internet is a
            <em>“user-agent”</em> in name only.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          We will soon have to confront an objectively more chaotic creature –
          an AI-powered <strong>personalized</strong> user-agent.
          <em>Personalized</em> meaning it knows a lot about us and will
          continue to learn about us. <em>User-agent</em> meaning it will take
          actions on our behalf. And, <em>AI-powered</em> at this point means
          that nobody really knows how it works. Let’s talk about what is about
          to happen and how you can prepare.
        </p>

          The User-Agent is supposed to be your buddy.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Information is intangible – you can’t stick your finger in it. So
          whenever we want to interact with a system that processes information,
          especially of the digital kind, we need some stand-in for our finger
          so that we can poke things.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, people came up with the concept of a <strong>user-agent</strong> –
          to refer to the device<a
            href="#fn1"
            class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref1"
            role="doc-noteref"
            interestfor="ref-1-preview"
            style="anchor-name: --ref-1-preview-anchor"
            ><sup>1</sup></a
          >
          that people interact with. People would push buttons, make holes in
          paper, turn knobs, or do whatever they need to do to communicate with
          the user-agent. The user-agent grasps what the person wants, and does
          what it needs to do to make the person’s wish a reality. On the
          flip-side, the user-agent also communicates results back in a form
          that the person can understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early user-agents were simple creatures with no intent of their own.
          It wasn’t that hard for people to look inside them to understand what
          it was doing. There was no mystery. The user-agent did what was asked,
          and earnestly reported back on what happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, in an email system, this user agent is called a mail user
          agent <abbr>MUA</abbr>. A user-agent that interacts with the web on
          our behalf should be called a web user agent (<abbr>WUA</abbr>)<a

            style="anchor-name: --ref-2-preview-anchor"
            ><sup>2</sup></a
          >. But because web user agents —which you might refer to as web
          browsers— are so dominant, people dropped the superfluous “web” part.

NAME
       mutt - The Mutt Mail User Agent

SYNOPSIS
       mutt [-hNpRxZ] [-s subject] [-c cc-addr] [-a file] ...
            [-F rcfile] [-H draft] [-i include] [-f mailbox]
            [address] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based MIME mail client.
       Mutt is highly configurable, and is well suited to the mail
       power user with advanced features like key bindings, keyboard
       macros, mail threading, regular expression searches and a
       powerful pattern matching language for selecting groups of
       messages.

       &quot;All mail clients suck.  This one just sucks less.&quot;
       - me, circa 1995</code></pre>

        <p>
          This was fine and dandy. People would fire up their user-agents, type
          commands, and the user-agent would do stuff and show the user results.
          But over time, these user agents evolved from simple command-line
          tools to much more fancy interactive, graphical browsers and services.
          Modern (<em>web</em>) user agents are not just programs, they are
          entire platforms<a

          Modern User-Agents are technical marvels.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Since the same internet needs to be accessible from different
          user-agents for perpetuity, the way web pages are written and made
          available on the internet had to be standardized – i.e. everyone
          needed to agree on the how. But these
          <em>technical specifications</em>, or <em>standards</em> grew bigger
          and bigger and so demanding that only a few well-resourced tech
          companies can write and maintain a full-featured UA<a
            href="#fn4"
            class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref4"
            role="doc-noteref"
            interestfor="ref-4-preview"
            style="anchor-name: --ref-4-preview-anchor"
            ><sup>4</sup></a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though voluminous, these standards are neither perfect nor complete.
          But they have been crafted through person-millennia of effort to
          ensure security and correctness. Organizations like the following work
          tirelessly to get the details right:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>World Wide Web Consortium</em> (<abbr>W3C</abbr>) is primary
            group that governs how web content is written.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group</em>
            (<abbr>WHATWG</abbr>) is the group that pushes the boundaries of
            what is possible to do inside the confies of a web browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Internet Engineering Task Force</em> (<abbr>IETF</abbr>) is the
            group governing how data moves about on the internet, and also how
            to keep your content secure while it is being moved about.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>The Unicode Consortium</em> is responsible for which letters and
            symbols you can use on the internet. They are the people who bring
            you new emoji every year.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>… and many others.</p>
        <h3 id="but-they-are-bound-by-the-same-implicit-social-contract">
          But they are bound by the same implicit social contract …
        </h3>
        <p>
          Beyond technical requirements, there is an increasingly important
          social contract: That the user-agent always act on behalf of the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          That means that the UA should do what you ask, and generally not do
          what you don’t ask.
        </p>
        <p>
          The latter –don’t do what the user didn’t ask– is a little complicated
          because of all the complexity involved in the modern web.
        </p>
        <p>
          Say you ask to see <code>bank.com</code> which is a bank. So the UA
          talks to the <code>bank.com</code> server and asks for the contents of
          the page. The contents say that some of the pictures on the web page
          need to be fetched from <code>advertiser.com</code>. But doing so
          involves sending a bunch of information to
          <code>advertiser.com</code> like the fact that you are viewing
          <code>bank.com</code> and information like your preferred language and
          whether you’ve been to these sites before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pretty much all UAs will opt to fetch the resources from
          <code>advertiser.com</code>, because otherwise the
          <code>bank.com</code>
          site will not work correctly. Since the user requested to see
          <code>bank.com</code>, clearly they intended for all the required
          stuff to get downloaded too, right? Except, it’s likely that the user
          never intended for <code>advertiser.com</code> to learn all that
          information about them.
        </p>
        <h3 id="that-the-user-agent-must-act-only-on-behalf-of-the-user.">
          That the User-Agent must act ONLY on behalf of the user.
        </h3>
        <p>Herein lies the problem.</p>
        <p>
          The modern web is a marvel in that it exists despite brutally
          conflicting interests, and is run by people who do not trust each
          other one bit<a
            href="#fn5"
            class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref5"
            role="doc-noteref"
            interestfor="ref-5-preview"
            style="anchor-name: --ref-5-preview-anchor"
            ><sup>5</sup></a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you really think the nice lady who made you read her life story
          before she told you how to make simple pancakes also made an ad for
          weight loss drugs? Of course not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behind the scenes, a “modern” web page is a warzone where multiple
          companies are playing tug of war with your data and limited attention
          span. Not only are these companies clamoring to show you video ads
          while you are trying to make pancakes, they are also trying to figure
          out where you’ve been and what you are into.
        </p>
        <p>
          You, the user, don’t want any of that; not even the nice lady’s life
          story. You just want to make pancakes. A UA that acted
          <em>only</em> on your behalf would have just pulled out the recipe
          part and shown it to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the short term, rewriting the web like this sounds great. But in
          the long term, those companies – who now have no one to show ads to –
          will stop paying the nice lady. And the nice lady will stop publishing
          her recipes. No ads, no recipes<a
            href="#fn6"
            class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref6"
            role="doc-noteref"
            interestfor="ref-6-preview"
            style="anchor-name: --ref-6-preview-anchor"
            ><sup>6</sup></a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          So to keep the web open, the UA does a tricky balancing act between
          conflicting interests; one that is not weighed 100% on your behalf.
          The UAs do their level best to present you with the most authentic
          web, while trying to keep you safe from potential attackers, without
          divulging too much about you to strangers. But this situation does
          mean that the “user agent” isn’t truly just the user’s agent.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it’s not just users vs. publishers and advertisers. There are many
          other influential groups on the web making the balance of interests
          difficult. Some are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>You</em>. Including here for completeness. You want to visit
              websites and be presented with accurate reproductions of what the
              publishers intended … kind of. You don’t want to be bothered by
              stuff that you don’t want, like advertisements. Also you want to
              be able to consume content freely and without boundaries. You want
              a free and open web.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Publishers</em> who make content on the web and give you a
              reason to visit it. There are many not-for-profit content that
              doesn’t have any commercial interests, but for those that do, it
              is important that they are able to make money publishing stuff.
              They also have lots of shared interests with users such as being
              able to publish what they want and to be able to reach their
              intended audiences. In addition sometimes they want to be able to
              publish things without identifying themselves.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Advertisers</em> who compete for your attention and make money
              by influencing your behavior. One of the ways in which they
              compete for your attention is by “renting” space alongside
              publishers’ content.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Search Engines</em> could be considered a kind of a publisher
              but they are special enough to get their own category. Search
              engines –at this point, mostly Google– act as the guides on the
              internet helping users find the content that they want. For this
              to work, search engines rely on the internet being open and free.
              Otherwise it would not be possible to take users to where they
              want to go. Since search engines are one of, if not, the primary
              tools users need on the internet they are always integrated deep
              into the UA.

              <em>Copyright owners and content rights holders</em> who are
              worried that people on the internet might steal their content. So
              web browsers have to incorporate
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management"
                >Digital Rights Management</a
              >
              components into the UA to limit what users can do with protected
              content.

              <em>Businesses</em> who want to make sure that you continue to
              trust the internet as a safe place to buy and sell stuff. So web
              browsers sometimes have to incorporate security measures (which
              actually help users a lot too) and easy to use payment methods.

              <em>Politicians</em>. Yes those people. As much as we would like
              to treat the internet as some sort of ungovernable utopia, it
              isn’t. There are many laws and regulations that are different
              across political boundaries. So sometimes UAs need to report
              <em>where</em> you are physically so that your activity can be
              kept within legal bounds. Politicians and businesses often also
              want to control what you are and aren’t able to access on the
              internet. However, they take those issues up with publishers and
              internet service providers. Additional shady things politicians
              want include finding out the real identities of people who have
              said things they don’t like.
            </p>
            <p>
              Shady stuff aside, politicians are also very useful. In fact as we
              will see below, legislation is pretty much the only way in which
              users can influence the big UA makers.

              <em>Internet Service Providers</em> (or ISPs) make money by making
              it possible for you to access the internet. You give them some
              money, and they give you internet access. Seems simple, but there
              are lots of shady things that ISPs want, like to charge you based
              on <em>what</em> you consume. See
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality"

          the biggest influences.

          But how do we know how the UA balances conflicting interests?
        </h3>
        <p>
          But how do we know that the UA isn’t completely complicit and isn’t
          selling our furniture without our knowledge? Why would we believe the
          UA is doing what it says it is doing? What does
          <q>too much about me</q> even mean?
        </p>
        <div class="sidenote-host-2">
          <p>
            Well <q>back in my day</q> one would crack open the UA and take a
            look inside. Usually, things are simple enough that you can convince
            yourself, or someone you trust can convince you, that it is in fact
            doing what it says it is doing.
          </p>
          <p>
            But modern UAs are so complex that such human inspection is
            impractical at best. Not only would you have to inspect millions of
            lines of code, you would have to inspect every new change as it
            comes in. Even then, there are parts of most commercial browsers
            that are closed source (i.e. they won’t let you look inside).
          </p>
          <p>
            So most of us have to trust the judgment and moral compass of the
            thousands of specialists poring over the underlying logic.

            Okay, so this might be a bit too harsh. Aren’t the biggest names in
            the browser game open source? Aren’t they all, like, based on
            Chromium? Why can’t we just read the source code and figure out
            whether it is doing anything odd?
          </p>
          <p>
            The reality is that people <em>have</em> and are actively watching
            open source browser projects with eagle eyes. There are even more
            people making sure any new standards on the web are good and are in
            the interest of users. Unfortunately, even if we can verify the open
            source parts of the browser, that’s not the end of the story. See,
            when you visit a web site, there could be data being sent to
            hundreds of websites. Even if the browser tells you each and every
            one of those web sites, it would not be practical for anyone to
            manually vet and understand what is going on. Even beyond that, not
            all the functional bits of a browser are open-source. In fact,
            perhaps the most questionable parts of a browser –like AI
            integration, media rights management, how it works with various
            hardware devices– are closed source for many reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            So it all boils down to whether it really matters if your security
            depends on you performing something infeasible for all practical
            purposes; kinda like being forced to read each and every privacy
            policy and binding contract you have to click through.

        <p>We’ve established that modern UAs…:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>… are super complicated.</li>
          <li>
            … have to blance conflicting interests of the user, publishers,
            advertisers, search engines, other businesses, copyright owners,
            politicians, internet service providers, and others.
          </li>
          <li>… are not designed 100% in your favor.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Despite vigilant oversight users still have to trust, without
          verification, how a UA works.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don’t trust one, you can always pick another. But you can’t
          avoid taking <em>someone’s</em> word that the UA is safe. Because of
          how little control we have as users over browsers, the only real way
          in which users can influence UAs is via legislation that holds UA
          owners accountable for their design decisions.

                documents), as technology progressed, the web browser became
                more and more capable of presenting complex behaviors. At the
                start they were just aesthetic – like blinking text or changing
                how a link looks like when you hover the mouse cursor over it.
                But over time, they have gained capabilities that rival native
                applications. Look at

                I worked on Google Chrome for over a decade on the networking
                stack, and briefly on the renderer. The amount of documentation
                that it takes to describe how a web browser works is in the
                order of tens of thousads of pages.

                Even then it is an understatement. The web works despite
                countless quirks and misbehaviors. That’s because modern
                browsers handle those quirks “correctly” to give the impression
                that everything is fine. These quirks and how to handle them
                aren’t necessarily written down anywhere. Browsers can’t just
                refuse to talk to large portions of the internet or refuse to
                render millions of older web pages just because the code
                wouldn’t look good.<a

                This ad-supported model of the open web sounds terrible; and in
                some ways it is. There are some alternatives that have been
                proposed over the years, but none have been successful as ads.
                Many approaches involve internet users making payments of some
                kind to publishers. Unfortunately, all such models have the
                downside that those who are impoverished will get kicked out of
                our global information village. So for now, this is the best we
                can do.

                AI will probably do in a few years what privacy advocates have

                As yet it’s unclear what will replace it, and whom this

                start they were just aesthetic – like blinking text or changing
                how a link looks like when you hover the mouse cursor over it.
                But over time, they have gained capabilities that rival native
                applications. Look at

                >
                that are available <em>inside</em> a browser.

                I worked on Google Chrome for over a decade on the networking
                stack, and briefly on the renderer. The amount of documentation
                that it takes to describe how a web browser works is in the
                order of tens of thousads of pages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even then it is an understatement. The web works despite
                countless quirks and misbehaviors. That’s because modern
                browsers handle those quirks “correctly” to give the impression
                that everything is fine. These quirks and how to handle them
                aren’t necessarily written down anywhere. Browsers can’t just
                refuse to talk to large portions of the internet or refuse to
                render millions of older web pages just because the code
                wouldn’t look good.

                This ad-supported model of the open web sounds terrible; and in
                some ways it is. There are some alternatives that have been
                proposed over the years, but none have been successful as ads.
                Many approaches involve internet users making payments of some
                kind to publishers. Unfortunately, all such models have the
                downside that those who are impoverished will get kicked out of
                our global information village. So for now, this is the best we
                can do.
              </p>
              <p>
                AI will probably do in a few years what privacy advocates have
                tried to do for decades; which is to kill the ad-supported web.
                As yet it’s unclear what will replace it, and whom this
                replacement leaves behind.

                  Large projects accumulate a large number of issue reports over
                  time. This is normal. Typically for a &quot;successful&quot;
                  project the rate of new issues being reported will exceed the
                  rate of issues being fixed. Hence the growth.

                  A recent study found that more gender-equal countries have
                  larger gender gaps in mental health. I look at the data that
                  seems to have yielded this counter-intuitive results and find
                  it lacking.

                  Hank Green's Crash Course YouTube channel has an excellent
                  series about navigating digital information. It's an excellent

                  Intellectual catchment areas are collaborative ecosystems
                  between universities and industries that attract talent and
                  ideas. The United States became a hub of intellectual capital
                  after World War II, thanks to a combination of industrial
                  growth around universities, significant research funding, and
                  favorable immigration policies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The current political climate is jeopardizing these
                  ecosystems. Continued threats against universities and
                  immigration could undo a century of progress, ultimately
                  depleting the nation's source of creativity and innovation.
