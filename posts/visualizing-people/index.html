        <p>What does 0.3%<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> of internet users look like?</p>
        <p>As of this writing the global population hovers around 7.7 billion
          according to the World Population Clock <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./census-gov-population-clock-2020-11-20.png" alt="Screenshot from census.gov showing the world population clock.">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Screenshot from census.gov showing the
            world population clock.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.itu.int/">International Telecommunications
            Union</a> “estimates that at the end of 2019, 53.6 per cent of the
          global population, or 4.1 billion people, are using the internet.”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./itu-internet-usage-stats-2019.jpg" alt="Screenshot from itu.int showing historical internet usage numbers as a percentage of the world population">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Screenshot from itu.int showing
            historical internet usage numbers as a percentage of the world
            population</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So a 0.3% of the internet would be a roughly 12,300,000 or around
          12.3 million. A nice little number.</p>
        <h2 id="from-50-to-100000">From 50 to 100,000</h2>
        <p>It’s interesting to try and visualize this. An example of visualizing
          populations for small numbers can be found at <a href="https://blog.lime.link/visualizing-crowd-sizes/">Visualizing Crowd
            Sizes</a>. It goes from around 50 people up to 100,000 people.</p>
        <p>While 100,000 is interesting we need to go all the way to 12.3
          million.</p>
        <h2 id="section">200,000</h2>
        <p>A particularly macabre topic these days since the United States
          surpassed 200,000 deaths due to COVID-19 around September of 2020. <a href="https://www.ctpost.com/">ctpost</a> ran an article online title <a href="https://www.ctpost.com/news/coronavirus/slideshow/Analysis-What-200-000-COVID-deaths-actually-209169.php">“What
            does 200,000 deaths actually look like”</a>. There are some interesting
          comparisons there, but none make for a good visual. It’s just an
          interesting number right now.</p>
        <p>As for crowd sizes, 200,000 was the estimated number of people who
          attended the <a href="https://marchforourlives.com/">March for Our
            Lives</a> in D.C.. There aren’t any photos capturing <em>all</em>
          attendees in one shot, but there are numerous pictures in <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/march-for-our-lives-crowd-size-estimated-200000-people-attended-d-c-march/">this
            CBS News article</a> to give you a good idea.</p>
        <p>In more terrible examples, <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/more-than-200000-indonesians-protest-governor-purnamas-alleged-blasphemy/a-36611145">this
            article on dw.com</a> suggests that the crowd size pictured is roughly
          around 200,000 people.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>More than 200,000 conservative Muslims gathered in Indonesia’s
            capital Jakarta on Friday to protest against the city’s Christian
            governor, who is facing trial for blasphemy, police estimated.</p>

        </figure>
        <h2 id="section-1">500,000</h2>
        <p>We are heading into shaky ground here. A 800*600 picture only
          contains 480,000 pixels. So we are now reduced to indicating population
          by inference. It is nolonger possible to capture 500,000 people in a
          webpage sized picture while showing each person individually.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/3by9g8/if_this_is_what_500k_people_look_like_xpost_from/">This
            Reddit post</a> claims that there are 500k people in the picture, but I
          couldn’t readily find any good references backing up that claim.</p>
        <p>As is tradition by now, another protest that drew 500,000 people is
          <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/show-me/video/nearly-500-000-people-march-in-anti-violence-rally-in-barcelona-1033617987741">an
            anti-violence rally in Barcelona as reported by NBC</a>. While there’s
          video, the content doesn’t quite capture the massive number of people.
          Also it’s “nearly 500,000” people.
        </p>
        <p>However, the closest we’ll probably get to a somewhat believable
          500,000 person crowd would be the March for Science. They posted the
          following picture on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marchforscience/posts/836983043362678">Facebook</a>
          noting that “There are 500,000 people on strike in Montreal”.</p>

        <h2 id="section-2">750,000</h2>
        <p>Off to protests again. This time we are looking at Barcelona where
          750,000 Catalan independence supporters are demanding the release of
          their leaders according to <a href="http://www.timealem.com/750000-people-flood-barcelona-demanding-release-of-catalan-leaders_d575.html">this
            article</a>.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./barcelona-protest-2020-11-20.jpg" alt="750,000 people flood Barcelona demanding release of Catalan leaders. Image source">

              source</a></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The crowd extends past the top of the frame and there’s no chance
          this is the entire crowd. But you get the general idea. If you ship a
          bug that affects 0.01% of the internet population, then this is a
          conservative lower bound of what that angry mob would look like.</p>
        <p>But wait, the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/non-corporate/2018/6/more-than-750-000-people-help-philippines-based-church-achieve-four-new-records-529029">Guinness
            World Record for teh largest charity walk/run</a> is 283,171 people at a
          single venue. Have a look at that picture:</p>

        </figure>
        <p>It seems that picture of 750,000 people doesn’t quite capture it
          because clearly there are more people in the picture that’s supposed to
          be 283k people. Which of course goes to show how hard it is to really
          capture how massive a crowd 750k makes.</p>
        <p>In an article on Wired that discusses how hard it is to estimate
          crowd sizes, they note<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Every time a ton of people gather in one place, there are all sorts
            of pronouncements made about how many folks really showed. The figures
            rarely agree; Glenn Beck’s rally on the National Mall this summer
            attracted a million people, according to Beck cohort Rep. Michelle
            Bachman. CBS News pegged it at more like 87,000.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3 id="and-more">And More</h3>
        <p>I’m going to give up at this point. Pictures purportedly of around
          one million people are mostly parts of crowds that have been estimated
          to be that big. Forget about 12.3 million.</p>
