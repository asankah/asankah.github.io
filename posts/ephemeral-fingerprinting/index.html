        <p>TL;DR:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Any web observable property whose changes are concurrently
              observable by multiple top-level sites can lead to cross site
              identity joining.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              This method of identity joining does not require additional
              coordination between multiple first parties. A single third party
              embedded within multiple first parties can also use this method.

          <strong>Figure 1</strong>: Two sites observe a sequence of device
          orientation changes at times 𝒕₀, 𝒕₁,𝒕₂ .
        </p>
        <p>
          All sites on the same UA instance share a clock and therefore can
          agree on the timestamps with a small margin of error. The triplet 𝒕₀,
          𝒕₁,𝒕₂ has a high probability of uniquely identifying the user. The two
          sites can thus use these observations to conclude that the
          observations originate from the same user.
        </p>
        <p>
          As illustrated above, one or more low entropy signals observed
          concurrently can be used to identify a user with a high degree of
          confidence. Let’s call these <strong>ephemeral fingerprints</strong>.
          This document discusses two types:
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
              <em
                >The sequence of timestamps corresponding to observed changes of
                a volatile surface can be used for identification</em
              >. Let’s call these <strong>correlated events</strong>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em
                >A stream of observations of a volatile surface can be
                identifying</em
              >. Let’s call these <strong>unique event streams</strong>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Signals considered for ephemeral fingerprinting don’t need to be
          highly identifying by themselves. The
          <a href="https://github.com/bslassey/privacy-budget"
            >privacy budget proposal</a
          >
          does not adequately account for fingerprinting based on concurrent
          observations of low entropy signals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Device orientation, from our earlier example, can take one of two
          values (portrait or landscape) and is unstable. Thus a single sample
          of device orientation carries almost no information. I.e. A recorded
          observation of device orientation doesn’t help at all with identifying
          the user at a later time. However the timestamps corresponding to
          orientation changes could have identifying levels of entropy.
        </p>

          These are not new. For example, this is discussed by Van Goethem et.

          Potential ephemeral fingerprinting surfaces also get flagged during
          standardization discussions (

        <h3 id="modelling-correlated-events">Modelling Correlated Events</h3>
        <p>
          A correlatable event can be thought of as the tuple
          <code>&lt;surface-sample, timestamp&gt;</code>. The addition of the
          timestamp strictly increases the amount of information carried by the
          surface sample.
        </p>
        <h3 id="modelling-event-streams">Modelling Event Streams</h3>
        <p>
          An event stream is simply a list of observed samples
          <code>sample₀, sample₁, ...</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each additional observation strictly increases the amount of
          information.

            For origins to which permission has been granted, the devicechange
            event will be emitted across browsing contexts and origins each time
            a new media device is added or removed; user agents can mitigate the
            risk of correlation of browsing activity across origins by fuzzing
            the timing of these events.

          Mentioned in the snippet above from the Media Capture and Streams API
          and called out by Jeffrey Yasskin as a potential general mitigation in

        <p>
          <strong>Goal</strong>: Deter identity correlation by third-party
          sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Restrict APIs to the origin of the

            >top-level browsing context</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The latter may choose to explicitly delegate access to the APIs via
          <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-feature-policy/"
            >feature policies</a
          >. But third-party contexts can’t “reach across” browsing contexts via
          correlation of cross context events or attributes that may be made
          available by the API.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Makes it a requirement that first-parties actively cooperate with
            other first-parties or third-parties. I.e. Good first-party + bad
            third-party = safe.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Difficult to retrofit into existing APIs.</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Browser-wide events and attributes are still visible to distinct
              top-level browsing contexts.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In practice top-level browsing contexts contain a fair amount of
              third party scripts which may access the same APIs. Furthermore
              there are financial incentives for first-parties to delegate API
              access to third-parties.

        <p>
          The Page Visibility API defines the

        <p>
          Restrict APIs to — possibly top-level — browsing context’s active

        <p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Is a convincing mitigation on mobile devices where only one

        <p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              There could be multiple visible browsing contexts which still

          Similar to the above, but addresses issues around polling by
          disallowing access to the entire API or sensitive attributes by
          restricting the entire API instead of just events.

        <p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Resilient to event stream fingerprinting via polling.</li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Can’t be easily retrofitted to existing APIs since it requires
              defining behavior for “disabled” APIs.

        <p><strong>Ephemeral fingerprints:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Require that multiple browsing contexts observe the same events or
              access the same volatile attribute.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              These browsing contexts could involve a single third party in
              multiple first party contexts.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Does not require precise clocks nor agreement on the exact
              timestamps of the observed events. Depending on the
              fingerprintable surfaces involved the sequence of events could be
              identifiable by itself. Servers can roughly bucket observations by
              time periods, eliminating the need for client-side clocks.

          <li>
            <p>
              Does not require an API to fire an event. A property with a
              volatile value that can be polled periodically is sufficient.

        <h3 id="what-to-look-for">What to look for:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Events with external triggers. E.g. hardware based events.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Multiple distinct events that are fired in tandem to distinct
              browsing contexts. E.g. any processing model where multiple events
              are fired.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Volatile attributes that are visible across browsing contexts.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Volatile attributes that don’t share values across browsing
              contexts, but change simultaneously. E.g. Salting a volatile
              attribute is insufficient if its mutations can be correlated.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="example">Example</h3>
        <p>Consider <code>onfocus</code> and <code>onblur</code> events.</p>
        <p>

          <a
            href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#focus-update-steps"
            >focus update steps</a
          >
          involve firing up to three distinct events: <code>change</code> if the
          node losing focus is an <code>input</code> element,
          <code>focus</code>, and <code>blur</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When focus traverses a browsing context boundary, these events may be
          fired simultaneously to two different browsing contexts. Browsers
          mitigate this by not firing <code>blur</code> for cross site tab
          switches, but they still fire <code>blur</code> when the browser
          itself goes out of focus. Thus identity can be correlated when
          switching browser windows.
