        <p>
          It’s been fourteen years since I joined Google. Much has happened
          since then, and people think the old Google is dead. This is somewhat
          correct.
        </p>
        <p>
          One way to understand what is happening is to compare and contrast the
          Google of yore and the present (as of late 2024) Google.

        <p>
          Perhaps the most defining moment for Google around 2010 was Google
          Search’s exit from China.
          <a
            href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/12/19/138307/how-google-took-on-china-and-lost/"
            >The reasons for the exit and the aftermath</a
          >
          are many. The high level reason was due to non-capitulance to the
          Chinese government’s demands for censorship and compromising user
          data.

          In addtion, Google’s hand was forced by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Aurora"
            >Operation Aurora</a
          >, a cyber attack on multiple US based companies including Google
          orchestrated by Chinese state actors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fascinating accounts of the events surrounding Operation Aurora is
          covered in a documentary called “Hacking Google”.

          Amazon and Microsoft were in a similar situation as Google. But they
          were unwilling to turn away from access to the Chinese market. There
          was a palpable sense of pride that we were working for the right
          company.

        <h3 id="to-project-nimbus">To Project Nimbus</h3>
        <p>Time changes everything.</p>
        <p>
          Eight years later Google reneged on its stance against censorship by
          attempting to build a censored search engine called
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(search_engine)"
            >Project Dragonfly</a
          >. The seeds of capitulance was well under way by this point despite
          the fact that the censored search engine project was ultimately
          dropped.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast-forward a few more years and we get to
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Nimbus"
            >Project Nimbus</a
          >. Google signed the contract despite warnings by its lawyers that
          <a
            href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/technology/google-israel-contract-project-nimbus.html?unlocked_article_code=1.mU4.GWhH.uw8jj2kv7n-n&amp;smid=url-share"
            ><em
              >“Google Cloud services could be used for, or linked to, the
              facilitation of human rights violations…”</em
            ></a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          One could argue that tools like Google Cloud services should be
          value-neutral. But even then, what matters here is that Google
          intentionally changed the terms-of-use for this contract to allow uses
          that were explicitly called out as going against Google’s values.
        </p>
        <h3 id="thats-where-we-are">That’s Where We Are</h3>
        <p>And that’s where we are right now.</p>
        <p>
          Google has had some rough years during which its relationship with the
          rest of the tech ecosystem and the world in general has changed. The
          old <em>“focus on the user and all else shall follow”</em> matra no
          longer applies. The company’s focus is now exclusively inwards where
          the fact that something benefits everyone is no longer justification
          to continue working on it. For example,
          <a
            href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/01/google-lays-off-staff-from-flutter-dart-python-weeks-before-its-developer-conference/"
            >Google laid off most of the core Python team</a
          >. While it may seem like a move towards cheaper labor, it is more
          than that. The previous Python team were also industry veterans who
          were effectively in the service of the broader Python community far
          beyond Google. The replacements are people who are tasked with
          maintaining internal tooling and not much else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google is no longer the giant benefactor of technology for everyone.
          However it’s still better than the other big tech companies. I keep
          telling myself that.

              Markdown documents should be readble without understanding complex
              mark-up. A growing number of Markdown syntax extensions take the
              form of HTML or HTML-like tags and boilerplate that hinder
              readability. Instead we should focus on how some construct should
              be presented in plain-text for human consumption and then add
              minimal structure to it for machine consumption.
