        <p>It’s been fourteen years since I joined Google. Much has happened
          since then, and people think the old Google is dead. This is somewhat
          correct.</p>
        <p>One way to understand what is happening is to compare and contrast
          the Google of yore and the present (as of late 2024) Google.</p>
        <h3 id="from-illegal-flower-tribute">From Illegal Flower Tribute</h3>
        <p>Perhaps the most defining moment for Google around 2010 was Google
          Search’s exit from China. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/12/19/138307/how-google-took-on-china-and-lost/">The
            reasons for the exit and the aftermath</a> are many. The high level
          reason was due to non-capitulance to the Chinese government’s demands
          for censorship and compromising user data.</p>

        <p>In addtion, Google’s hand was forced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Aurora">Operation
            Aurora</a>, a cyber attack on multiple US based companies including
          Google orchestrated by Chinese state actors.</p>
        <p>The fascinating accounts of the events surrounding Operation Aurora
          is covered in a documentary called “Hacking Google”.</p>

        <p>Amazon and Microsoft were in a similar situation as Google. But they
          were unwilling to turn away from access to the Chinese market. There was
          a palpable sense of pride that we were working for the right
          company.</p>
        <h3 id="to-project-nimbus">To Project Nimbus</h3>
        <p>Time changes everything.</p>
        <p>Eight years later Google reneged on its stance against censorship by
          attempting to build a censored search engine called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(search_engine)">Project
            Dragonfly</a>. The seeds of capitulance was well under way by this point
          despite the fact that the censored search engine project was ultimately
          dropped.</p>
        <p>Fast-forward a few more years and we get to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Nimbus">Project Nimbus</a>.
          Google signed the contract despite warnings by its lawyers that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/technology/google-israel-contract-project-nimbus.html?unlocked_article_code=1.mU4.GWhH.uw8jj2kv7n-n&amp;smid=url-share"><em>“Google
Cloud services could be used for, or linked to, the facilitation of
human rights violations…”</em></a>.</p>
        <p>One could argue that tools like Google Cloud services should be
          value-neutral. But even then, what matters here is that Google
          intentionally changed the terms-of-use for this contract to allow uses
          that were explicitly called out as going against Google’s values.</p>
        <h3 id="thats-where-we-are">That’s Where We Are</h3>
        <p>And that’s where we are right now.</p>
        <p>Google has had some rough years during which its relationship with
          the rest of the tech ecosystem and the world in general has changed. The
          old <em>“focus on the user and all else shall follow”</em> matra no
          longer applies. The company’s focus is now exclusively inwards where the
          fact that something benefits everyone is no longer justification to
          continue working on it. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/01/google-lays-off-staff-from-flutter-dart-python-weeks-before-its-developer-conference/">Google
            laid off most of the core Python team</a>. While it may seem like a move
          towards cheaper labor, it is more than that. The previous Python team
          were also industry veterans who were effectively in the service of the
          broader Python community far beyond Google. The replacements are people
          who are tasked with maintaining internal tooling and not much else.</p>
        <p>Google is no longer the giant benefactor of technology for everyone.
          However it’s still better than the other big tech companies. I keep
          telling myself that.</p>

            <p>Claude Shannon's <em>A mathematical theory of communication</em> is an oft cited

              &quot;why&quot;s that are often overlooked when people build on top of the introduced
              theory. They are definitely things that I didn't consider to be obvious
