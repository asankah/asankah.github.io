        <p>Today is the first day of <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/why-the-us-celebrates-womens-history-month-every-march">Women’s
            History Month</a>.</p>
        <p>Coincidentally there’s a paper making the rounds titled <em>“The
gender gap in adolescent mental health: A cross-national investigation
of 566,829 adolescents across 73 countries”</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="campbell2021gender"><a href="#ref-campbell2021gender" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span>, which makes some these interesting
          claims:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Girls have worse average mental health than boys across 4 mental
            health measures.</li>
          <li>There is significant heterogeneity in the mental health gender gap
            size across countries.</li>
          <li>The gap is most pronounced for psychological distress and life
            satisfaction.</li>
          <li>More gender-equal countries have more gender gaps in mental
            health.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The last point, in particular, is a bit of an eyebrow-raiser. So
          let’s have a closer look.</p>
        <p>The study uses the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2018database/">PISA 2018
            dataset</a>, introducing a couple of caveats. Namely:</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>All survey respondents were 15 years old; thus, the dataset doesn’t
            consider higher education and employment effects.</li>
          <li>The data is from 2018; thus excludes the effects of the pandemic. It
            would be interesting to see how the responses change now that people are
            coming out of a lengthy lock down.</li>
          <li>Gender was binary. There was no non-binary option.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The study <span class="citation" data-cites="campbell2021gender"><a href="#ref-campbell2021gender" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span>
          derives five measures of mental health based on the PISA 2018 dataset as
          follows:</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p><em>“Life satisfaction”</em> measures responses to the question
              <em>“on a scale of 0-10, overall, how satisfied are you with your life
as a whole these days?”</em>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><em>“Psychological distress”</em> measures responses to the
              question on how often they felt <em>“sad”</em>, <em>“miserable”</em>,
              <em>“scared”</em>, and <em>“afraid”</em> on a scale of <em>“never”</em>,
              <em>“rarely”</em>, <em>“sometimes”</em>, and <em>“always”</em>. Each
              response yields points ranging from 1 through 4, respectively. Summing
              the points for each question results in a score of 4-16.
            </p>
            <p>The survey doesn’t appear to have clarified the difference between
              <em>“sad”</em>/<em>“miserable”</em> and
              <em>“scared”</em>/<em>“afraid”</em>. PISA 2018 mentions that:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>All questions were translated into the languages of participating
                countries by two independent linguists and then reconciled by a third to
                ensure consistent meaning in all countries.</p>
            </blockquote>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><em>“Hedonia”</em> measures the responses to the question on how
              often they felt <em>“happy”</em>, <em>“lively”</em>, <em>“proud”</em>,
              <em>“joyful”</em>, and <em>“cheerful”</em> on the same scale. This
              yields a combined scale of 5-20.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><em>“Eudaemonic wellbeing”</em> measures the degree of agreement
              with the below statements. The scale was <em>“strongly disagree”</em>,
              <em>“disagree”</em>, <em>“agree”</em>, and <em>“strongly agree”</em>
              with a combined score in the range 3-12:
            </p>
            <ol type="1">
              <li><em>“My life has clear meaning or purpose”</em>.</li>
              <li><em>“I have discovered a satisfactory meaning in life.”</em></li>
              <li><em>“I have a clear sense of what gives meaning to my
life”</em>.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Details of the analysis are in <a href="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S2352827321000173-mmc1.pdf">the
            companion document (PDF link)</a>.</p>
        <p>In figure S2 of <span class="citation" data-cites="campbell2021gender"><a href="#ref-campbell2021gender" role="doc-biblioref">[1]</a></span> shows the distribution of <em>life
satisfaction</em>. Again, developed nations are not doing well compared
          with countries like Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/posts/gender-gap-in-adolescent-mental-health/WRXvVZYAsx-941.png" alt="Distribution of life satisfaction scores for France, Germany, Greece, and Iceland. The range of responses were from 0 through 10. Red is male, and blue is female." width="941" height="237">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Distribution of life satisfaction scores
            for France, Germany, Greece, and Iceland. The range of responses were
            from 0 through 10. Red is male, and blue is female.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Compare with:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/posts/gender-gap-in-adolescent-mental-health/BMgV4WaLC8-484.png" alt="Distribution of life satisfaction scores for Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. Note that most respondents gave a score of 10." width="484" height="213">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Distribution of life satisfaction scores
            for Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. Note that most respondents
            gave a score of 10.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>I’m skeptical that these numbers represent reality. Unless there’s a
          part of Saudi Arabia where adolescents are consistently happy all the
          time, these numbers don’t make sense. My skepticism is also extended to
          the data from the UAE. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2021/country-chapters/united-arab-emirates">Human
            Rights Watch’s report on the UAE</a> indicates that the UAE is far from
          having any semblance of gender equality. Approximately 80% of the
          population consists of migrant workers <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/21/thousands-of-children-in-uae-has-no-access-to-schooling-report">who’s
            children don’t have access to formal education</a>. It’s unlikely that
          these children of migrants participated in the study.</p>
        <p>The curve fitting for the resulting graphs is what tells the stories
          that are summarized at the start of this post. The axes are arranged so
          that moving towards the right and moving upwards indicate better
          conditions. Hence it’s apparent from the curves that male life
          satisfaction is pretty consistent and not affected all that much by
          GII<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Meanwhile, female life satisfaction
          trends <em>downward</em> as GII improves; hence the conclusion that more
          gender equality implies less happiness.</p>
        <p>GSNI (Gender Social Norms Index) is also negatively correlated with
          quality-of-life measures (where we put “good” on the high end and “bad”
          on the low end).</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/posts/gender-gap-in-adolescent-mental-health/ExZlAvw4RK-3253.png" alt="Life satisfaction plotted against per-capita GDP, Gini index, GII, GSNI, GGGI. The curves don’t quite fit very well." width="3253" height="894">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Life satisfaction plotted against
            per-capita GDP, Gini index, GII, GSNI, GGGI. The curves don’t quite fit
            very well.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>All the graphs show a high variance. Only a small number of countries
          are present in the study. And whether the subjects of the study are
          representative of the population is in doubt. Overall I find the study
          unconvincing.</p>
