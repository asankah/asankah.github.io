        <p>Note: Originally published on 2023 September 8. Revised 2023 November

        <p>Re-orgs.</p>
        <p>It’s a fact of life for large organizations. A popular metaphor
          making the rounds now is this concept of pillars. The metaphor makes
          sense to some extent.</p>
        <h2 id="a-house-without-a-foundation">A house without a foundation</h2>
        <p>Let’s start with a picture of how a sanitized version of a pillar
          structure would look like.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/posts/pillars-are-governance-structures/DU7-1ly9fQ-519.png" alt="A goal at the top and a bunch of pillars at the bottom. No foundation." width="519" height="463">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">A goal at the top and a bunch of pillars
            at the bottom. No foundation.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>On the top is some kind of goal or an organization. In the case of an
          organization we can think of organization’s mission as the goal. Pillars
          support the goal.</p>
        <h2 id="stage-2-subpillars">Stage 2: Subpillars</h2>
        <figure>
          <img src="/posts/pillars-are-governance-structures/GsJRiUw904-532.png" alt="A goal at the top, a bunch of pillars holding it up, and then a bunch of subpillars. Still no foundation." width="532" height="496">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">A goal at the top, a bunch of pillars
            holding it up, and then a bunch of subpillars. Still no
            foundation.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Massive corporations can’t be organized around a handful of pillars.
          We need more structure: subpillars.</p>
        <p>The subpillars are holding up the pillars. Together all of them hold
          up the goal.</p>
        <p>Collectively what we are looking at is a system for organizing
          people. One that is hierarchical and tree structured.</p>
        <p>We all know this. Because that’s what org charts have always looked
          like.</p>
        <h2 id="team-topologies">Team Topologies</h2>
        <p>In <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TeamTopologies.html">TeamTopologies</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Martin Fowler et. al. discusses
          different kinds of software teams.</p>
        <p>One can think of pillars and sub-pillars as being higher level
          structures for organizing these teams. Individual teams at the
          granularity at which team topologies apply are too granular for
          pillars.</p>
        <p>What I found compelling in “Team Topologies” were the concepts of
          <strong>Outcome Oriented teams</strong> and <strong>Activity Oriented
teams</strong>. These have always had names – <strong>project
teams</strong> and <strong>service teams</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>Fowler’s article mentions</p>
        <p>To put it in a nutshell,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Outcome oriented teams</strong> are teams that are
              working towards something. They hope to achieve some sort of goal, and
              once it is achieved the purpose of the team has been fulfilled and
              typically people move on to other things.</p>
            <p>Outcome oriented teams have specific measurable goals like…</p>
            <ul>
              <li>build a thing,</li>
              <li>make specific qualitative change happen,</li>
              <li>research something, or</li>
              <li>achieve a sales goal.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Activity oriented teams</strong> are teams that perform
              some sort of activity for the organization. They do things like keeping
              the lights on, bug fixing, and occasional feature development. Activity
              oriented teams are typically in the service of enabling an outcome.</p>
            <p>Activity oriented teams have qualitative goals like</p>
            <ul>
              <li>uptime,</li>
              <li>efficiency,</li>
              <li>user-satisfaction, and</li>
              <li>level of support.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are more details and nuances and much hair-splitting. But the
          gist of it can be understood without diving too far into the weeds. What
          is important is that …</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Outcome oriented teams and activity oriented teams can mutually
            depend on each other.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Also …</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>A single outcome oriented team can depend on multime activity
              oriented teams.</p>
            <p>For example, a team tasked with building a new service will depend on
              multiple existing services that are under the purview of multiple
              activity oriented teams.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>A single activity oriented team can depend on multiple outcome
              oriented teams.</p>
            <p>For example, a team tasked with maintaining a critical service will
              at times need to implement large changes or features, which require
              multiple outcome oriented teams.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Uh oh. Our organization is not tree-shaped anymore.</p>
        <h2 id="its-a-graph">It’s a Graph</h2>
        <figure>
          <img src="/posts/pillars-are-governance-structures/Mx5pE1QtKt-569.png" alt="Interdependencies form a graph, not a tree." width="569" height="666">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Interdependencies form a graph, not a
            tree.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The problem is that the the thing we are trying to organize is not
          tree structured. Each group has relationships that stretch vertically
          along the reporting chain, and also horizontally across “enabling”
          teams, support teams, infrastructure teams, or other teams that are
          solving similar problems.</p>
        <p>An organization especially at this level of abstraction cannot
          represent all this complexity. A large number of free-floating small
          teams interacting with each other won’t be very efficient<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.
          Nor is it conducive to goals at a large scale because that would require
          a degree of cooperation that won’t appear spontaneously.</p>
        <p>So we need to steer this pool of teams. It needs some structure so
          that some higher level of management can coordinate a number of smaller
          groups; so that they can collectively work towards a common but larger
          goal.</p>
        <p>With this newfound knowledge we can once again approach the pillars
          but this time with goals and activities for the higher level teams.</p>
        <h2 id="its-a-tree-again">It’s a Tree (Again)</h2>
        <p>However, the leadership needs to figure out which of these
          relationships to organize around.</p>
        <p>This isn’t quite satisfactory yet because we can’t made things fit
          into the pillar system. Once people get stuck on pillars everything
          needs to be a pillar.</p>
        <p>We can, however, stick teams into pillars. These teams would be
          outcome oriented if they are stuck into outcome oriented pillars. It
          follows that activity oriented pillars will need to be stuck into
          activity oriented pillars.</p>
        <p>So it’ll kind of look like this:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="/posts/pillars-are-governance-structures/DoEEdLA9De-519.png" alt="Big organization, goals, outcome oriented pillars, outcome oriented teams, activity oriented pillars, and activity oriented teams" width="519" height="565">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Big organization, goals, outcome oriented
            pillars, outcome oriented teams, activity oriented pillars, and activity
            oriented teams</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>And there you have it.</p>
        <p>In reality, the structure can be made much cleaner once you start
          asking each team what their goals are.</p>
        <p>But the gist of it is you can’t plan teams or pillars until you know
          what their goals are.</p>

                network of interdependencies. Sure, it’s leaving people in poverty and
