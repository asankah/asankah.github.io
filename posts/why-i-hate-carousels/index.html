        <p>A carousel interaction pattern looks like this:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./dell.png" alt="A screenshot of dell.com from Nielsen Norman Group’s article on effective design of carousels.">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">A screenshot of dell.com from <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/designing-effective-carousels/">Nielsen
              Norman Group’s article on effective design of
              carousels</a>.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Basically it’s a layout pattern where one starts out positioning
          content in vertical blocks. Some of those blocks are going to have
          content arranged in horizontal blocks.</p>
        <p>So far so good. You might think this will result in a layout that
          roughly looks like this:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./vertical-and-horizontal-layout.png" alt="A layout consisting of vertically arranged blocks. One of the blocks contains a set of horizontally arranged blocks.">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">A layout consisting of vertically
            arranged blocks. One of the blocks contains a set of horizontally
            arranged blocks.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>This is a pretty common block structured layout. So common in fact
          that most block structured layouts will flip orientation by nesting
          level. If you nest a layout block inside a block that has vertical
          layout then the inner block will automatically switch to doing
          horizontal layout.</p>
        <p>Notice that the entire layout fits snugly within the viewport.</p>
        <h3 id="layout-runneth-over">Layout Runneth Over</h3>
        <p>Interesting stuff happen when the layout doesn’t fit inside the
          viewport. When it doesn’t fit vertically, obviously you’ll have to
          scroll up and down to see the whole thing.</p>
        <p>However, if <em>only the horizontal block doesn’t fit</em>, that’s
          when the carousel pattern kicks in. So now things start looking like
          this:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./layout-with-overflow.png" alt="The layout no longer fits within the cofines of the viewport.">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">The layout no longer fits within the
            cofines of the viewport.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>How do you construct a UI affordance that lets people pan around
          this? Of course you use … wait I already mentioned it ..
          <strong>pan</strong>. Maybe use scroll bars or just about any other
          scrolling affordance.
        </p>
        <p>So would it look like this if you scroll both horizontally and
          vertically a little bit?</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./shifted-viewport-position.png" alt="A viewport shifted a little bit both horizontally and vertically. The relative position of the blocks are still the same as before. Large portions of the viewport are now blank.">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">A viewport shifted a little bit both
            horizontally and vertically. The relative position of the blocks are
            still the same as before. Large portions of the viewport are now
            blank.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3 id="sliiiiiide-to-the-right">Sliiiiiide To The Right</h3>
        <p>To address all the blankness, the carousel pattern posits that the
          the overflowing horizontal bits should be moved around independently of
          the vertical bits. Like this:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./sliding-around-horizontally.png" alt="Vertically arranged bits move vertically. Horizontally arranged bits move horizontally.">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Vertically arranged bits move vertically.
            Horizontally arranged bits move horizontally.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We once again have the problem of affordances. There are many ways of
          doing this. Most devices have some way of panning around both
          horizontally and vertically. So the solution is obvious. Right?</p>
        <p>If people stop here and implement that, then that would’ve been
          over.</p>
        <h3 id="uh-oh.-here-come-the-dots-of-stupidity">Uh oh. Here come the
          dots of stupidity…</h3>
        <p>Instead, they went with this:</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./dots-of-stupidity.png" alt="Dots of stupidity. Little circles and left and right arrows. When you click/tap on the left arrow button, the carousal slides to the left. When you click/tap on the right arrow button, the carousel moves to the right.">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Dots of stupidity. Little circles and
            left and right arrows. When you click/tap on the left arrow button, the
            carousal slides to the left. When you click/tap on the right arrow
            button, the carousel moves to the right.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Let me summarize this interaction pattern.</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Use scroll bars, or whatever scrolling afforance to scroll up and
            down to access bits that are above and below the viewport.</li>
          <li>Click/tap on little circles with arrows to access bits that are on
            either side of the viewport but only within the single sliding carousel
            block containing the arrows.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There’s a couple of problems with this:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The obvious wonkiness of having two different methods of scrolling
            horizontally and vertically.</li>
          <li>Too easy to tap on the underlying “tile” instead of the
            dot-of-stupidity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Carousel sympathizers explain the reasoning for this as follows:</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p><em>What if there was more than one horizontally sliding
thingies? How would one know which horizontally sliding thingy to apply
the horizontal scroll operation to?</em></p>
            <p>This is a purely hypothetical problem that often doesn’t exist. But I
              understand that UX designers have to account for the
              possibility.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><em>It’s okay because the user doesn’t always need to or want to
see everything in the carousal. Why bother them with details they don’t
need?</em></p>
            <p>That’s nice, but how would the user know they don’t need to see the
              thing without seeing the thing? It might be possible if all the visible
              things in the carousel were irrelevant to the user then they’ll just
              ignore the whole carousel.</p>
            <p>But what about the very users who <em>are</em> interested? They need
              to jump through hoops to look at the things that <em>are</em>
              relevant.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><em>What if there’s sooo many things in the horizontal slidey bit
that we can’t possibly accommodate all of it?</em></p>
            <p><strong>Someone has to click on the little dot with the arrow enough
times to see each one incrementally. The number of items for which such
a UI works is far smaller than a UI where one scrolls past them using a
much more ergonomic interface.</strong></p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="whats-better">What’s Better?</h3>
        <p>Try wrapping the horizontal blocks so the page only overflows
          vertically.</p>
        <p>If there’s too many things to fit in a vertical overflow layout, then
          there’s already too many things for anyone to click through individual
          cards to see.</p>
        <p>Just show the user a good subsample. If it whets their appetite, then
          offer them a link to take them to a dedicated page.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./vertical-overflow-only.png" alt="Wrap the horizontal blocks so there’s only vertical overflow.">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Wrap the horizontal blocks so there’s
            only vertical overflow.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3 id="in-summary">In Summary</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Don’t use carousels in your UI.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Instead, if you must stick content into little cards, let
the horionztal layout wrap to additional lines.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>If you end up with too many horizontal lines of content,
then you definitely have too many items that can be accessed via a
horizontally panning UI. You need a different UI
altogether.</strong></li>
        </ul>
