          What if you introduce a bug and/or a feature that pisses off a million
          people?
        </p>
        <p>
          The scenario isn’t all that hard to imagine these days if you work at
          a big tech company or even a small one with a considerable user base.
          It seems a million users aren’t all that hard to reach these days.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is harder though is to imagine what a million people looks like.
          What if you were being stared down by the entirety of the affected
          user base? Or worse you had to stand on a stage in front of them and
          explain yourself?
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have 1 billion users and you ship a bug that only manifests 1
          in a million times, then you have yourself 1000 angry users. It’s good
          to know what that group looks like.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can easily imagine a single person, 10, or even 25 people. But
          exceed a couple of hundred and our imagination falters. It becomes
          just a number and stops feeling like “users” or “people.” The
          perceived significance of the population thus starts to diminish.
        </p>
        <h1 id="so-whats-the-significance-of-a-million-people-anyway">
          So what’s the significance of a million people anyway?
        </h1>
        <p>
          World population is teetering on roughly 7.7 billion people (in 2019).
          So
          <strong
            >a million people is about 0.01% of the global population</strong
          >.

          Internet users, on the other hand, come up to something like half of
          the world population based World Bank figures which
          <em>imply</em> that roughly 50% of the population should have internet
          access in 2021

        </p>
        <p>
          But once you focus on a smaller scale like a geographic region or a
          user base of some application, then suddenly the million users looks
          much bigger.

            Rustin coordinated a staff of over 200 civil rights activists and

            marchers, organizing churches to raise money, coordinating buses and
            trains, and administering all of the other logistical details. In
            many ways, the March defied expectations. The number of people that
            attended exceeded the initial estimates made by the organizers.
            Rustin had indicated that they expected over 100,000 people to
            attend - the final estimate was 250,000, 190,000 blacks and 60,000

        <p>
          We are heading into shaky ground here. A 800*600 picture only contains
          480,000 pixels. So we are now reduced to indicating population by
          inference. It is no longer possible to capture 500,000 people in a
          webpage sized picture while showing each person individually.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a

            >This Reddit post</a
          >
          claims that there are 500k people in the picture, but I couldn’t
          readily find any good references backing up that claim.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another event that drew 500,000 people is
          <a

            >an anti-violence rally in Barcelona as reported by NBC</a
          >. While there’s video, the content doesn’t quite capture the massive
          number of people. Also it’s <em>“nearly 500,000”</em> people.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the closest we’ll probably get to a somewhat believable
          500,000 person crowd would be the March for Science. They posted the
          following picture on

          The crowd extends past the top of the frame and there’s no chance this

            Guinness Record for the largest charity walk or run at a single

          It seems that picture of 750,000 people doesn’t quite capture that
          many people because clearly there are more people in the picture
          that’s supposed to be 283k people. Which of course goes to show how
          hard it is to really capture how massive a crowd 750k makes.

            Every time a ton of people gather in one place, there are all sorts
            of pronouncements made about how many folks really showed. The
            figures rarely agree; Glenn Beck’s rally on the National Mall this
            summer attracted a million people, according to Beck cohort
            Rep. Michelle Bachman. CBS News pegged it at more like 87,000.

          I’m going to give up at this point. Pictures purportedly of around one
          million people are mostly parts of crowds that have been estimated to
          be that big.

                  Claude Shannon's
                  <em>A mathematical theory of communication</em> is an oft
                  cited classic in information theory. Let's dive in and try to
                  tease apart the &quot;why&quot;s that are often overlooked
                  when people build on top of the introduced theory. They are
                  definitely things that I didn't consider to be obvious without
                  the benefit of reading the paper.
