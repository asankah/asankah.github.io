          <p>This article was formerly published as <a href="../visualizing-people/">Visualizing Internet Users</a>. This
            version is more generalized and up-to-date.</p>
        </div>
        <p>What if you introduce a bug and/or a feature that pisses off a
          million people?</p>
        <p>The scenario isn’t all that hard to imagine these days if you work at
          a big tech company or even a small one with a considerable user base. It
          seems a million users aren’t all that hard to reach these days.</p>
        <p>What is harder though is to imagine what a million people looks like.
          What if you were being stared down by the entirety of the affected user
          base? Or worse you had to stand on a stage in front of them and explain
          yourself?</p>
        <p>If you have 1 billion users and you ship a bug that only manifests 1
          in a million times, then you have yourself 1000 angry users. It’s good
          to know what that group looks like.</p>
        <p>We can easily imagine a single person, 10, or even 25 people. But
          exceed a couple of hundred and our imagination falters. It becomes just
          a number and stops feeling like “users” or “people.” The perceived
          significance of the population thus starts to diminish.</p>
        <h1 id="so-whats-the-significance-of-a-million-people-anyway">So what’s
          the significance of a million people anyway?</h1>
        <p>World population is teetering on roughly 7.7 billion people (in
          2019). So <strong>a million people is about 0.01% of the global
population</strong>.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="world-population-2021.png" alt="Figure 1: World population in 2021 is 7.7 billion approximately.">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Figure 1: World population in 2021 is 7.7
            billion approximately.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Internet users, on the other hand, come up to something like half of
          the world population based World Bank figures which <em>imply</em> that
          roughly 50% of the population should have internet access in 2021 <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="worldbank-individuals-using-internet.webp" alt="Figure 2: Percentage of population who has access to the internet (World Bank 2017)">

            has access to the internet (World Bank 2017)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>So <strong>a million users would be 0.02% of the population with some
access to the internet</strong>. Still not that big.</p>
        <p>But once you focus on a smaller scale like a geographic region or a
          user base of some application, then suddenly the million users looks
          much bigger.</p>
        <h2 id="to-49">1 to 49</h2>
        <p>Let’s skip this range since this is in the range of what you’d see in
          a mirror, can fit on a bicycle, can fit on a sofa, your team, gathering
          of friends, significant annual family event, or other familiar
          situation.</p>
        <h2 id="from-50-to-100000">From 50 to 100,000</h2>
        <p>An example of visualizing populations for small numbers can be found
          at <a href="https://blog.lime.link/visualizing-crowd-sizes/">Visualizing
            Crowd Sizes</a>. It goes from around 50 people up to 100,000 people.</p>
        <p>While 100,000 is interesting we need to go all the way to 1
          million.</p>
        <h2 id="section">200,000</h2>
        <p>200,000 was the estimated number of people who attended the <a href="https://marchforourlives.com/">March for Our Lives</a> in D.C..
          There aren’t any photos capturing <em>all</em> attendees in one shot,
          but there are numerous pictures in <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/march-for-our-lives-crowd-size-estimated-200000-people-attended-d-c-march/">this
            CBS News article</a> to give you a good idea.</p>
        <p>In more terrible examples, <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/more-than-200000-indonesians-protest-governor-purnamas-alleged-blasphemy/a-36611145">this
            article on dw.com</a> suggests that the crowd size pictured is roughly
          around 200,000 people.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>More than 200,000 conservative Muslims gathered in Indonesia’s
            capital Jakarta on Friday to protest against the city’s Christian
            governor, who is facing trial for blasphemy, police estimated.</p>

        <h2 id="section-1">250,000</h2>
        <p>The March on Washington in 1963– an <em>“event focused on employment
discrimination, civil rights abuses against African Americans, Latinos,
and other disenfranchised groups, and support for the Civil Rights Act
that the Kennedy Administration was attempting to pass through
Congress”</em> – drew an estimated 250,000 people according to the
          National Park Service.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Rustin coordinated a staff of over 200 civil rights activists and
            organizers to assist in publicizing the march and recruiting marchers,
            organizing churches to raise money, coordinating buses and trains, and
            administering all of the other logistical details. In many ways, the
            March defied expectations. The number of people that attended exceeded
            the initial estimates made by the organizers. Rustin had indicated that
            they expected over 100,000 people to attend - the final estimate was
            250,000, 190,000 blacks and 60,000 whites.</p>

        <h2 id="section-2">500,000</h2>
        <p>We are heading into shaky ground here. A 800*600 picture only
          contains 480,000 pixels. So we are now reduced to indicating population
          by inference. It is no longer possible to capture 500,000 people in a
          webpage sized picture while showing each person individually.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/3by9g8/if_this_is_what_500k_people_look_like_xpost_from/">This
            Reddit post</a> claims that there are 500k people in the picture, but I
          couldn’t readily find any good references backing up that claim.</p>
        <p>Another event that drew 500,000 people is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/show-me/video/nearly-500-000-people-march-in-anti-violence-rally-in-barcelona-1033617987741">an
            anti-violence rally in Barcelona as reported by NBC</a>. While there’s
          video, the content doesn’t quite capture the massive number of people.
          Also it’s <em>“nearly 500,000”</em> people.</p>
        <p>However, the closest we’ll probably get to a somewhat believable
          500,000 person crowd would be the March for Science. They posted the
          following picture on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marchforscience/posts/836983043362678">Facebook</a>
          noting that “There are 500,000 people on strike in Montreal”.</p>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock">Woodstock</a> or
          “an Aquarian Exposition: 3 Days of Peace &amp; Music” festival held in
          1969 reportedly attracted “over 400,000”, “450,000”, or “500,000” people
          depending on the source. Let’s assume that the real number is somewhere
          in-between which gets us to somewhere in the neighborhood of 500,000
          people.</p>
        <p>There are numerous aerial photos of the Woodstock crowds, some of
          which you can find in <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/photos/woodstock-and-aerial">this
            image gallery from Getty images</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="section-3">750,000</h2>
        <p>Off to look at protests again. This time we are looking at Barcelona
          where 750,000 Catalan independence supporters are demanding the release
          of their leaders according to <a href="http://www.timealem.com/750000-people-flood-barcelona-demanding-release-of-catalan-leaders_d575.html">this
            article</a>.</p>

          <img src="barcelona-protest-2020-11-20.jpg" alt="750,000 people flood Barcelona demanding release of Catalan leaders. Image source">

              source</a></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The crowd extends past the top of the frame and there’s no chance
          this is the entire crowd. But you get the general idea. If you ship a
          bug that affects 0.01% of the internet population, then this is a
          conservative lower bound of what that angry mob would look like.</p>
        <p>But wait, the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/non-corporate/2018/6/more-than-750-000-people-help-philippines-based-church-achieve-four-new-records-529029">Guinness
            World Record for the largest charity walk/run</a> is 283,171 people at a
          single venue. Have a look at that picture:</p>

        </figure>
        <p>It seems that picture of 750,000 people doesn’t quite capture that
          many people because clearly there are more people in the picture that’s
          supposed to be 283k people. Which of course goes to show how hard it is
          to really capture how massive a crowd 750k makes.</p>
        <p>In an article on Wired that discusses how hard it is to estimate
          crowd sizes, they note<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Every time a ton of people gather in one place, there are all sorts
            of pronouncements made about how many folks really showed. The figures
            rarely agree; Glenn Beck’s rally on the National Mall this summer
            attracted a million people, according to Beck cohort Rep. Michelle
            Bachman. CBS News pegged it at more like 87,000.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2 id="and-more">And More</h2>
        <p>I’m going to give up at this point. Pictures purportedly of around
          one million people are mostly parts of crowds that have been estimated
          to be that big.</p>
