        <p><strong>Q</strong>: How do you win a soccer match?</p>
        <p><strong>A</strong>: Score more goals than the other team.</p>
        <p>This is a dumb strategy, right? But why?</p>
        <p>Compared to a more <em>reasonable</em> strategy like start preparing
          with plenty of time to spare, invest in a good team, hire a good coach
          and what not, <em>why</em> is scoring more goals a dumb strategy? That’s
          because the bad strategy didn’t <strong>reduce risk</strong>.</p>
        <p>The whole point of a strategy is to mitigate risk. One could imagine
          gathering up a bunch of random people and somehow lucking out at the
          game and winning it. You need a strategy if you don’t want to leave
          everything to chance.</p>
        <p>That’s why the next strategy you write down needs to account for
          these:</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>State your goal clearly.</p>
            <p>A good goal should clearly articulate <strong>the outcome</strong>,
              and <strong>constraints</strong>. E.g. MVP available for limited testing
              (<em>the outcome</em>) by end of Q4 (<em>the constraint</em>).</p>
            <p>It should be obvious to anyone when the goal has been reached. This
              is by design, since there should not be any question of what you are
              collectively trying to accomplish.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Identify the risks.</p>
            <p>Mitigating risks begin by identifying them. Some risks are obvouls,
              but still write them down because you need to address them.</p>
            <p>Failing to meet the goal is an obvious risk, but why would you fail
              to meet the goal?</p>
            <p>A common reasons is simply that you need more time. E.g. you are at
              risk of not meeting the constraints due to underestimating the amount of
              work required.</p>
            <p>Another reason could be technology you are using not performing as
              expected due to bugs. Every part of your tech stack is a gamble. A part
              that you don’t own is a specially big risk because you may not be able
              to fix it or work around a problem.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Figure out how to mitigate the risks.</p>
            <p>At risk of schedules slipping? Have intermediate deliverables and
              milestones along the way. Instead of everything falling apart at the
              end, you’ll know when things are not going to schedule much earlier in
              the product life cycle. Knowing early means that you can address them
              before failures snowball into a giant ball of trouble.</p>
            <p>Unreliable tech-stack? Choose stacks that have a solid user base and
              support structure. A project with bugs that are getting addressed is a
              lower risk than one that hasn’t seen any updates in a year.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Stack up your goal, risks, and mitigations.</p>
            <p>There’s your strategy.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>It’s not a strategy is risks are not identified and mitigated.</p>
        <p>A common mistake is to write down a list of steps that, if followed,
          achieve a stated goal. A good first step. But the unless the strategy
          can <strong>reduce</strong> risk, it is not a useful.</p>

            <p>Any ephemeral low-entropy web observable property whose changes are
              concurrently observable by multiple sites can lead to cross site identity
              joining.</p>
            <p>This method of identity joining does not require coordination between
              multiple first parties. A single third party embedded within multiple first
              parties can also use this method.</p>

            <p>Claude Shannon's <em>A mathematical theory of communication</em> is an oft cited
              classic in information theory. Let's dive in and try to tease apart the
              &quot;why&quot;s that are often overlooked when people build on top of the introduced
              theory. They are definitely things that I didn't consider to be obvious
              without the benefit of reading the paper.</p>
