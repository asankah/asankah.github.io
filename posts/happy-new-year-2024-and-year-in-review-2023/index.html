inflicting on ourselves in Ukrain, the Gaza strip, Myanmar, Niger,
Burkina Faso, Azawad, Tunisia, Sudan, Columbia, Afganistan, Pakistan,
Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Iraq, Rwanda, Burundi,
Mexico, Camaroon, Chad, Syria, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, United Arab
Emirates, Ethiopia, Haiti, and pretty much everwhere.</p><p>Instead let’s skip over to the the weirdness that happened in the
tech sector.</p><h2 id=generative-ai-has-entered-the-chat>Generative AI Has Entered
The Chat</h2><p>Educated people often make the mistake of underestimating the
disruption that can happen in an industry. In this case, we are talking
about generative AI and its disruption of the tech sector.</p><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_%28machine_learning_model%29>Transformer
models</a> have been around for a while (since before 2017) but they
have mostly been a curiousity rather than a serious practical tool. It
held much promise and excitement but was considered to be a technology
that was in its infancy. The only real production workloads they handled
were around machine translation.</p><p>However, a sudden disruption happened in 2023 where:</p><ul><li>AI models become capable enough to give a somewhat convincing
approximation of intelligence. This led people to conclude that
generative AI is now ready for use in industry – a claim that is
debateable.</li><li>Generative AI models became accessible to the general public largely
in the form of ChatGPT though others followed quickly.<a href=#fn1 class=footnote-ref id=fnref1 role=doc-noteref><sup>1</sup></a></li><li>People started incorporating generative AI into their lives and
businesses.<a href=#fn2 class=footnote-ref id=fnref2 role=doc-noteref><sup>2</sup></a><a href=#fn3 class=footnote-ref id=fnref3 role=doc-noteref><sup>3</sup></a><a href=#fn4 class=footnote-ref id=fnref4 role=doc-noteref><sup>4</sup></a></li><li>This triggered an influx of financial investment in generative AI.<a href=#fn5 class=footnote-ref id=fnref5 role=doc-noteref><sup>5</sup></a><a href=#fn6 class=footnote-ref id=fnref6 role=doc-noteref><sup>6</sup></a></li><li>Which was followed closely by legislation that aimed to mitigate the
perceived harm of AI.<a href=#fn7 class=footnote-ref id=fnref7 role=doc-noteref><sup>7</sup></a></li></ul><p>All this in the span of a year.</p><p>I’m not directly involved in any ML work, so the way I experienced it
was:</p><ul><li>At the start of the year I had a couple of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing>NLP</a>
projects that I had lined up to complete by the end of the year. The
tasks were somewhat complex and involved fiddling with a lot of
NLP.</li><li>By the end of the year the tasks were reduced to producing a prompt
for an LLM and then parsing its result.</li></ul><p>In addition to all the assistive coding tasks that are pretty much
production ready at this point, the transformation of a complex coding
task into simple English question and answer is kind of mind
blowing.</p><p>I’m waiting to see what the new year is going to bring in terms of
automation. We are truly living in the future.</p><aside id=footnotes class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document" role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn1><p><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/generative-ai-statistics/#:~:text=45%25%20of%20the%20US%20population%20surveyed%20is%20using%20generative%20AI.">“45%
