        <p>I hope everyone has a great year in 2024!</p>
        <h2 id="what-we-are-leaving-behind">What We Are Leaving Behind</h2>
        <p>I’m acknowledging but not going into details of the cruelty we are
          inflicting on ourselves in Ukrain, the Gaza strip, Myanmar, Niger,
          Burkina Faso, Azawad, Tunisia, Sudan, Columbia, Afganistan, Pakistan,
          Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Iraq, Rwanda, Burundi,
          Mexico, Camaroon, Chad, Syria, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, United Arab
          Emirates, Ethiopia, Haiti, and pretty much everwhere.</p>
        <p>Instead let’s skip over to the the weirdness that happened in the
          tech sector.</p>
        <h2 id="generative-ai-has-entered-the-chat">Generative AI Has Entered
          The Chat</h2>
        <p>Educated people often make the mistake of underestimating the
          disruption that can happen in an industry. In this case, we are talking
          about generative AI and its disruption of the tech sector.</p>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_%28machine_learning_model%29">Transformer
            models</a> have been around for a while (since before 2017) but they
          have mostly been a curiousity rather than a serious practical tool. It
          held much promise and excitement but was considered to be a technology
          that was in its infancy. The only real production workloads they handled
          were around machine translation.</p>
        <p>However, a sudden disruption happened in 2023 where:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>AI models become capable enough to give a somewhat convincing
            approximation of intelligence. This led people to conclude that
            generative AI is now ready for use in industry – a claim that is
            debateable.</li>
          <li>Generative AI models became accessible to the general public largely
            in the form of ChatGPT though others followed quickly.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
          <li>People started incorporating generative AI into their lives and
            businesses.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
          <li>This triggered an influx of financial investment in generative AI.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></li>
          <li>Which was followed closely by legislation that aimed to mitigate the
            perceived harm of AI.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>All this in the span of a year.</p>
        <p>I’m not directly involved in any ML work, so the way I experienced it
          was:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>At the start of the year I had a couple of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">NLP</a>
            projects that I had lined up to complete by the end of the year. The
            tasks were somewhat complex and involved fiddling with a lot of
            NLP.</li>
          <li>By the end of the year the tasks were reduced to producing a prompt
            for an LLM and then parsing its result.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to all the assistive coding tasks that are pretty much
          production ready at this point, the transformation of a complex coding
          task into simple English question and answer is kind of mind
          blowing.</p>
        <p>I’m waiting to see what the new year is going to bring in terms of
          automation. We are truly living in the future.</p>
