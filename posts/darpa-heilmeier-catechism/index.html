        <p>It seems the hardest part of engineering is the part where you are
          staring at a blank page with a vague notion of a problem statement in
          your head.</p>
        <p>First you seek structure. After all your attention span can only hold
          so much at the same time. In order to tackle larger problems, you need
          to reduce large parts of the problem area into intuition. And in turn,
          to reduce parts of the problem into intuition, you need to break those
          pieces into smaller simpler pieces that you can chew on
          individually.</p>
        <p>Losing sight of the forest for the trees is easy during this
          process.</p>
        <p>Why were you trying to solve this problem in the first place? Would
          you have started if you knew then what you know now about the real scope
          of the problem?</p>
        <p>Such concerns are also part of the problem statement; parts that help
          your prioritize and select the best solution amongst many. Throughout
          all, it’s always good to keep and eye on the prize. That being the end
          goal of the exercise. The goal must justify the effort involved. Once
          again, for that you need to reduce your motives into intuition.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism">“The
            Heilmeier Catechism”</a> is “a set of questions […] to help Agency
          officials think through and evaluate proposed research programs”. The
          list of questions is duplicated here for your convenience. It’s a short
          and terse list. Much like what your design sketch should be.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using
            absolutely no jargon.</li>
          <li>How is it done today, and what are the limits of current
            practice?</li>
          <li>What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be
            successful?</li>
          <li>Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?</li>
          <li>What are the risks?</li>
          <li>How much will it cost?</li>
          <li>How long will it take?</li>
          <li>What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?</li>
        </ul>

            <p>Markdown documents should be readble without understanding complex mark-up.
              A growing number of Markdown syntax extensions take the form of HTML or
              HTML-like tags and boilerplate that hinder readability.
              Instead we should focus on how some construct should be presented in plain-text
              for human consumption and then add minimal structure to it for machine consumption.</p>
