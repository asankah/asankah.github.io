# [Ephemeral Fingerprinting](ephemeral-fingerprinting/)

TL;DR:

*   Any ephemeral low-entropy web observable property whose changes are
    concurrently observable by multiple sites can lead to cross site identity
    joining.

*   This method of identity joining does not require coordination between
    multiple first parties. A single third party embedded within multiple first
    parties can also use this method.

# [Identity Domains](identity-domains/)

TL;DR:

*   An identity domain is a scope within which the privacy threat model can
    assume that the user's identity can be shared.
