            form the communication structures within and across teams. Forming
            these structures require teammates to have some level of autonomy.
            In turn this requires a team stucture that allows the team the
            freedom of movement to reconfigure itself to serve the teams’ goals.

            Unfortunately incentives are seldom constructed by those who

            <em>“official”</em> organizational structure from collapsing.

          If the conditions are right, a healthy team will fill in the gaps by
          rebalancing their responsibilities. Such a rebalancing will inevitably
          lead to an uneven distribution of burden. With time the burden will
          become increasingly visceral, which will lead to burnout, resentment,
          and attrition. For an uneven burden to be sustained, that burden must
          be commesurately rewarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Accurately measuring the contributions of each team member is a
          hitherto unsolved problem. Managers are often left with gut instincts
          to fall back on, which comes with a laundry list of shortcomings like
          bias and favoritism. Those who come up with the right formula against
          all odds are celebrated as <em>good managers</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          People write books and give speeches about their favorite
          <em>good manager</em>. But often the actual skills involved aren’t
          articulated. The list of skills isn’t long. Primarily these skills
          revolve around the ability to understand what each person is
          <em>doing</em>. Secondairly they revolve around the ability to
          understand how those actions <em>affect the rest of the team</em>.
          Both require a manager to have visibility into how the team interacts
          – either by direct observation or by frequent and extensive
          communication with each team member.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of this still won’t do much if the team desn’t have psychological
          safety. Without this, team members may not be willing to recognize and
          reward their peers. Nor would they be liklely to disclose bad news in
          a timely manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bad incentive structures lead to people ridigly performing just their
          roles and letting things fail around them (<em>“it’s not my job”</em
          >).<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"
            ><sup>2</sup></a
          >
        </p>
        <p>To summarize, good things happen when the incentives for a team:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Never pit employees against each other. One person’s success cannot
            be another’s downfall.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assume that the leadership hasn’t figured out exactly what needs to
            be done. The team should be empowered to course-correct as they
            learn.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reward those who pull the team together and help the team
            communicate internally and externally.
          </li>

                Claude Shannon's
                <em>A mathematical theory of communication</em> is an oft cited
                classic in information theory. Let's dive in and try to tease
                apart the &quot;why&quot;s that are often overlooked when people
                build on top of the introduced theory. They are definitely
                things that I didn't consider to be obvious without the benefit
                of reading the paper.

                While managers may be constrained in their communication,
                special individuals create unofficial channels where team
                members feel safe to share information. Acting as social hubs or
                &quot;speakeasies,&quot; they foster trust and enable the free
                flow of timely, factual information, which helps colleagues make
                better decisions and navigate turmoil. Despite their critical
                function in preventing team collapse and reducing isolation,
                this &quot;glue work&quot; is typically not formally recognized
                or compensated.
