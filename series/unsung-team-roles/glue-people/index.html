            The concept of glue work isn’t new. Team building, mentoring,
            running meetings, and many other mundane tasks fall under this
            category of often uncompensated work. How glue work establishes
            unofficial communication structures within and across teams is,
            however, discussed less often.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Not every manager is a great communicator; and that’s okay. This is
          specially true in large tech companies where the people management
          ladders are the natural next step for individual contributors who are
          seeking career growth. When important information that affects
          people’s careers isn’t communicated in a fair and timely manner, trust
          collapses taking down the team with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bound by needs for confidentiality and mandatory reporting, managers
          are often not the best people to confide in or trust. Meanwhile peers
          with the right set of social skills become speakeasies: people with
          whom others feel psychologically safe. The level of trust between a
          speakeasy and other team members can be much higher than with
          managers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consequently, these speakeasies become social hubs where both work and
          non-work related information flow freely. Some might call it gossip.
          But when the information is factual and timely, it can help teammates
          made better decisions, at least for themselves if not for the company.
          In times of turmoil – like the increasingly frequent
          <em>“once-in-a-lifetime”</em> recessions that keep happening in the US
          – the glue people take on a dual role: as a pressure release valve for
          individuals, and as a vehicle for breaking their sense of isolation.
        </p>
        <p>
          No surprise that such roles cannot be written down in a normal job
          description. Also of no surprise that such roles aren’t recognized nor
          compensated.
        </p>
        <aside class="sidenote-1">
          <h4 id="losing-a-glue-person">Losing a Glue Person</h4>
          <p>
            I was tempted to write about this after the departure of a coworker.
            The extent to which they were holding the team together was not
            apparent until they left.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team is spread out across many geographic regions, so pretty
            much all of our interactions are online. Our team chats are more
            than just sources of work information, they are also where most of
            the socialization happens. So the tone and spirit of communication
            is critical for engagement. Once the keeper of the spirit left, the
            chats fell silent. And suddenly, it seemed, we became strangers.

              Claude Shannon's
              <em>A mathematical theory of communication</em> is an oft cited
              classic in information theory. Let's dive in and try to tease
              apart the &quot;why&quot;s that are often overlooked when people
              build on top of the introduced theory. They are definitely things
              that I didn't consider to be obvious without the benefit of
              reading the paper.
