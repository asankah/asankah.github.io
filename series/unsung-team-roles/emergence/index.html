          Google’s early success is partly attributed to the use of commodity
          hardware that were expected to break occasionally. Rather than
          demanding perfection from complex systems it is far more effective to
          expect and design around imperfections<a

            Similarly when we design products, we design them for fallible users
            who are prone to making occasional mistakes, and beholden to some
            number of misconceptions.
          </p>

            The <em>misconceptions</em> referred to here are misunderstandings
            of how the product or process works. It could be situational
            misunderstandings (e.g. confusion about how to accomplish an
            immediate goal), or it could be a more persistent fundamental
            misunderstanding about how something works (e.g. misunderstanding
            <a
              href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/common-myths-about-private-browsing"

            With real world problems, information flow is never perfect. Loss of
            precision at each stage of discovery, analysis, prototyping, and
            implementation leads to potential for misconceptions. See
            <a href="/posts/secret-life-of-systems/"
              >The Secret Life of Systems</a
            >
            for an illustration of how real world problems and the
            implementation of a solution may not align.

          As we design products, so we must design our internal processes. We
          once again assume that our teammates are fallible, prone to making
          occasional mistakes, and operating under some number of
          misconceptions<a

        <p>
          Fallibility runs both ways up and down the org chart. Leaders operate
          under vague, incomplete, and sometimes wildly inaccurate information<a
            href="#fn3"
            class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref3"

            ><sup>3</sup></a
          >. Further complicating matters, it is impossible to understand the
          capabilities and shortcomings of each individual person or understand
          every nuance of what must constitute a role.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result is that team roles are neither comprehensive nor precise.
          In any given team structure people are expected to adapt to a broad
          range of situations that are unpredictable, and frankly unknowable.
          Some (most?) of those situations are directly due to other team
          members.
        </p>
        <p>
          As teams mature, the <em>actual</em> role each person takes on will
          gradually anneal around individual strengths and weaknesses forged by
          need and cemented through consistency.
        </p>
        <p>
          So in reality, what is intended to be a neat and well circumscribed
          role profile becomes irregular, illdefined, and dynamic.
        </p>

        <p>
          In short: Following the spirit of designing with imperfections, team
          organization must always account for this fluidity of roles.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Roles in a team will rarely be circumscribed by the corresponding
            job description. People will always do work outside their scope.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roles will overlap in ways that will run counter to the intents of
            the official role allocations. People will do other’s work
            occasionally.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em
              >Roles will emerge that are not mentioned in anyone’s job
              description.</em
            >
            Sometimes called <em>soft</em> roles.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In this series we will look at a few of these soft roles that emerge
          often and look into the critical work that these roles perform.

                A former Googler, Avery Penwarr wrote an influential document
                while they were at Google called <em>View from Above</em> about
                the perspective of executives. Fortunately he also wrote a
                public version called
                <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=201909"
                  >What do executives do anyway?</a
                >. The basic premise is that when it comes to any big decision,
                the executive highest up the ladder is the least informed about
                the pertinent details – but that’s okay because knowing the
                details isn’t their job.

                  Any ephemeral low-entropy web observable property whose
                  changes are concurrently observable by multiple sites can lead
                  to cross site identity joining.

                  This method of identity joining does not require coordination
                  between multiple first parties. A single third party embedded
                  within multiple first parties can also use this method.

                  Evaluating properties like inclusion and equity of products
                  can't be done through exhaustive enumeration of product
                  outcomes. Instead we will need to increasingly rely on the
                  controls that we place how we construct the products.
