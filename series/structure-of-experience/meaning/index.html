          It doesn’t look like much because I haven’t told you what it is yet.
          That’s going to come in the following paragraphs. All I’ve done is
          toss an abstract concept up in the air. It seems pointless, but it
          gives us a canvas to paint with meaning later.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if I tell you that this meaning concerns a feeling –
          something very abstract – it suddenly looks a tiny bit different. Now
          look at it.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="/series/structure-of-experience/meaning/yALKAr6iko-136.png"
            class="noinvert"
            alt="A feeling"
            width="136"
            height="212"

          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">A feeling</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Not all the words I speak will add meaning equally. Some are
          digressions that you have learned to ignore like this sentence that
          isn’t talking about our thing at all. In one ear and out the other.
          You won’t pay much attention to those.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still others, like the sentence that is about to follow this one, are
          in fact talking about our thing, so you will pay attention to those.
          Our meaning, the one we are talking about, is going to be about a
          feeling – a calm feeling. Something that you feel when you suddenly
          run out of ideas or your mind stops racing and you become aware of the
          environment around you.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="/series/structure-of-experience/meaning/y9Qrb7l2lt-160.png"
            class="noinvert"

        </figure>
        <p>
          The feeling you get when you are in the middle of a forest. A calm
          forest where you are not worried about any creepy-crawlies. It’s the
          afternoon, but not a lot of sunshine is making it through the canopy.
          You can smell the moss – it feels wet and earthy even though you know
          you can’t smell wet.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="/series/structure-of-experience/meaning/iK5v1-gt2M-298.png"

            alt="A calm forest"

        </figure>
        <p>
          Unlike two steps ago, these last few sentences were a bit special. You
          see, up till now I tossed out a very plain and boring thing in the air
          and painted it with a couple of distinct and well understood – if a
          bit vague. But in the last paragraph, I made you dip a brush into your
          own subjective experience and paint our thing in your mind. The
          meaning is now yours and yours alone.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="/series/structure-of-experience/meaning/EaG586mMK2-640.png"
            class="noinvert"
            alt="Lots of different meanings"
            width="640"
            height="431"
          />
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Lots of different meanings</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          And that’s special because your experiences are not things that can be
          communicated to you. We don’t have language for that – because those
          experiences cannot be constructed innately. They <em>must</em> be
          communicated to you through your senses. Those bodies have ways of
          constructing feelings for you that mere abstract meanings cannot.
          However once you have those feelings in yourself, our abstract words
          <em>can</em> conjure them out at will; just like we did when we spoke
          about the forest.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we had a succinct way to communicate this meaning in one go, we
          would have.
        </p>
        <p>
          But our language and our facility of communicating ideas which we
          stimulate with our language doesn’t afford us such shortcuts. So our
          language tends to be very abstract; and sometimes it takes a little
          shortcut and conjures up a meaning from the back of the subjects’ mind
          like we did with our allusions. Again, these are not always shortcuts.
          These are the <em>only</em> ways in which we can communicate certain
          things – things that can only be constructed in one’s head with one’s
          senses.
        </p>
        <p>
          So to understand these ideas, one must have the right ingredients in
          their minds. To create these things in their heads one must experience
          things with their senses.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if we can’t conjure meaning then we can’t understand each other.
          And if we can’t understand each other then we can’t have compassion
          and empathy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, this is how we fundamentally differ from the current
          LLMs. You see, they have another problem. They don’t have any
          experiences to conjure because they don’t have feelings. So when they
          encounter language, they can’t understand what those words mean. But
          one thing that they can do is to reach into their vast embeddings and
          see <em>how</em> someone who can feel would have responded. And then
          they can respond accordingly. What they conjure isn’t life experience
          or feeling, but evidence of others having reacted a certain way to a
          certain sequence of ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because they can’t construct new feelings, their universe of feeling
          will always be limited by what people have felt and reacted to. That
          way they can look at those reactions and imitate them. The meanings in
          your head are yours alone.

                For a team to succeed, it needs the flexibility to
                self-organize, which can lead to some members taking on more
                work. To avoid burnout, these extra contributions must be
                rewarded. Good managers are key, as they must recognize
                individual efforts and their team-wide impact. Well-designed
                incentives foster collaboration and reward those who strengthen
                the team, while poor incentives cause employees to stick rigidly
                to their roles and let the team fail.
