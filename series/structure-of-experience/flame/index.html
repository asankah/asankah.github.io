          We are prone to anthropomorphizing anything that looks or acts vaguely
          lifelike. All the way back in the 1960s, when people were confronted
          with a rudimentary chatbot, they were convinced that it embodied
          empathy and understanding (<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect"
            >ELIZA effect</a
          >)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"
            ><sup>1</sup></a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Roll forward to the 2020’s and chatbots are substantially more
          complicated. Unsurprisingly, people attribute more and more human
          qualities to bots. We saw
          <a
            href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/11/google-ai-lamda-blake-lemoine/"
            >people stake their reputations</a
          >
          on the claim that some AI systems are sentient and therefore have
          feelings that might be hurt by humans’ relentless experimentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are obvious ethical considerations that follow from such claims.
          <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/exploring-model-welfare"
            >Anthropic recently announced</a
          >
          (April 24, 2025) that this is a question they wish to explore in
          earnest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anthropic’s work is very forward looking. Currently, we are nowhere
          near an answer to the question of whether LLMs are conscious. However
          there are good reasons why they aren’t.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before answering the question of whether something is conscious, one
          must know what consciousness is. We don’t know what that is yet (see
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness"
            >The hard problem of consciousness</a
          >). Our near term goal is to establish what’s called
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_correlates_of_consciousness"
            >neural correlates of consciousness</a
          >
          – observable phenomena in the human brain that are highly correlated
          with the subject’s state of consciousness. We haven’t yet (as of this
          writing on May 5, 2025) achieved this near term goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Short of knowing what brings about subjective experience, people
          resort to convoluted experiments like
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room"
            >the Chinese room</a
          >
          to eliminate situations where consciousness is absent and to point out
          that nothing along the path we are traversing really reaches any
          meaningful self-awareness.

        <p>
          Is this picture of a flame hot? There never was an actual flame in
          this instance because this image was generated by AI. The AI may have
          seen pictures of many real candles, but it has never felt the warmth
          of a candle. It is therefore safe to assume that the sense of heat
          played no role in this picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          What if we start with a more realistic looking model of a flame. Then
          we can calculate how the flame should behave<a
            href="#fn2"
            class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref2"
            role="doc-noteref"
            ><sup>2</sup></a
          >
          with time. No matter how detailed this model is, the model does not
          constitute a flame. We can crank up the fidelity and accuracy of our
          calculations as far up as technology allows, but it will still not
          burst into flame<a
            href="#fn3"
            class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref3"
            role="doc-noteref"
            ><sup>3</sup></a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is where we are with AI and consciousness. We have descriptions
          of how to determine the next word in a sequence of words. These
          descriptions are extremely detailed and based on unfathomable amounts
          of information. They are so complicated that nobody knows how they
          behave, so the only way we can find out what they will do is to run
          them against some input and see what happens. We know these models can
          be made even more complicated than their current, already incredible,
          complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
          But no matter how far we go, we still only have a description and a
          thing that can interpret this description. We can increase the
          complexity of the description or increase the speed of the
          interpreter, but there is no setting on this continuum where
          information suddenly becomes self-aware. It is intuitive that the
          description will not achieve any physical accomplishment no matter
          where we take it. So the mechanism of consciousness must depend on the
          implementation of the interpreter. Currently, that too has no “ignite
          consciousness” threshold.
        </p>
        <p>So this post will also end the way Anthropic’s announcement does:</p>
        <figure>
          <p>
            “There’s no scientific consensus on how to even approach these
            questions or make progress on them. In light of this, we’re
            approaching the topic with humility and with as few assumptions as
            possible. We recognize that we’ll need to regularly revise our ideas
            as the field develops.”

                ELIZA is fascinating in how simple the whole system is while
                being seemingly complex. You can play around with some modern

                This is a very broad area of research. Search for
                <em>flame dynamics</em>. E.g.

                  href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001046551830403X"

                Technically if the equipment heats up enough, then it
                <em>might</em> actually burst into flame. But that has nothing
                to do with the specifics of the flame we are trying to simulate.
                It can just as well happen while trying to

                In any team, the roles people play are not as rigid as they
                seem. Over time, people naturally settle into &quot;soft
                roles&quot; that are not explicitly defined but are crucial for
                a team's success. This is a look at the organic, and often
                unsung, ways that successful teams actually work.
