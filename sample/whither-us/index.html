            I fully expect this post to age poorly, as would any piece that
            purports to predict the future of AI. But my confidence in our
            ability to take care of each other and thrive as a species is
            faltering.

          <p>
            AI is only going to be an enormously powerful accelerator of
            inequality – at least in the short term. While changes will manifest
            differently from the industrial revolution, the power structures are
            the same, and the outcome will also be the same.

          is correct and we are in fact irredeemable as a species. Before we get
          wiped out because we are bad custodians of the planet, a few more
          things are much more likely to happen, like the coming wave of
          automation.
        </p>
        <p>
          What would a world look like if most white-collar jobs have been
          automated away?
        </p>
        <h3 id="can-talk-cant-walk">Can Talk, Can’t Walk</h3>
        <p>
          Unlike what science fiction authors of yore surmised, precise motor
          skills along with navigating around the world turned out to be more
          difficult to emulate than tasks that were previously considered to be
          in the realm of creativity and human nature. We thought there would be
          dumb humanoid robots doing laundry and cooking for us while us humans
          wrote poetry and painted sunsets. That’s not how it’s turning out.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s good reason for it. Humans are great at adaptation. Hoofing it
          around the planet turned out to involve substantial intuition about
          the world we inhabit. Every moment we maintain a model of the world
          around us and our own body. Millenia of adaptation and a lifetime of
          experience informs this model. Replicating such a system is
        </p>
        <p>
          Easiest tasks for an information processing machine to do turned out
          to be spitting out more information. The easiest jobs to automate, in
          turn, turned out to be in the realm of media generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          For millennia humanity humbly curated the most desirable patterns of
          words, pictures, and sounds. Our time tested method of being good at
          creating these things is to imitate other good works of art – good
          artists borrow, great artists steal. Large language models are
          exceptionally good at picking out patterns in media and replicating
          them. Pattern recognition and replication is our MO.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it comes as no surprise that LLMs have turned out to be exceptional
          at producing creative works.
        </p>
        <h3 id="curate-curate-curate">Curate Curate Curate</h3>
        <p>
          However, AIs have one big handicap: they can’t feel. A LLM cannot
          determine the <em>goodness</em> of some piece of media or a sequence
          of words. All it can do is to follow the patterns it has seen and
          elicit the same exclamations it has seen people elicit when presented
          with similar patterns. For anything new they need humans to feel for
          them, and the way we feel on their behalf is to continue our sacred
          duty to curate the best media.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to YouTube, TikTok, and others, we have democratized media
          creation in the past couple of decades. Mass creation of media also
          leads to the problem of curation and recommendation. After all, nobody
          has the time to go through everything anymore. So these platforms also
          created the most effective recommendation systems. The same advantages
          that machine learning had at recognizing patterns and recreating them
          came in super handy. In an almost reductionist fashion, these
          platforms consumed our reactions – the views, and thumbs ups, the
          hearts – and learned exactly what to present in front of our eyes to
          keep us engaged. These are the perfect platforms to harvest signals
          about our preferences. It is likely that – for better or for worse –
          we will continue to perform this duty of training machines to
          entertain us, partly because we can’t stop ourselves. We are stuck in
          a positive feedback loop. Our recommendation systems powering these
          are just too good.

          Where Is All The Wealth Going?
        </h3>
        <p>
          But why would an AI continue to entertain us? Because we want it to.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next wave of jobs that are the easiest to automate are information
          processing jobs: tasks where a person ingests some information in some
          form, and produces more information in another form. It’s crucial that
          not a lot of reasoning happens in between, because as much as people
          like to believe we’ve built reasoning machines, we are not quite there
          yet

          Every economic system in the world unfailingly does one thing well:
          they saturate labor. They reach equilibrium when labor supply is
          exhausted – in more ways than one. How these systems differ is in the
          quality of life that is afforded those who labor.

            I draw the conclusion that, assuming no important wars and no
            important increase in population, the <em>economic problem</em> may
            be solved, or be at least within sight of solution, within a hundred
            years. This means that the economic problem is not-if we look into
            the <em>future-the permanent problem of the human race</em>.

          Given that the essay was written in 1930, it’s close to the 100 year
          mark since the essay, and the economic problem is very much not
          solved. To be honest I’d give it another 100 years for the ideals
          mentioned in the essay to come to fruition. What ideals, you might
          ask?
        </p>
        <p>
          Keynes categorized needs into two broad categories: absolute and
          relative. Absolute needs are those that we now consider to be
          inelastic demands – things like housing, food, healthcare. Relative
          needs are those arising from our appetite to feel superior.
        </p>
        <p>
          His expectation was that society will mature to a point where we will
          share the bounties of the exponentially increasing productivity thus
          satiating the absolute needs of most everyone. The rich would
          gradually let go of the need for the accumulation of wealth and grow
          to be weary of it.

            The love of money as a possession -as distinguished from the love of
            money as a means to the enjoyments and realities of life -will be
            recognised for what it is, a somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of
            those semicriminal, semi-pathological propensities which one hands
            over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease.

          Disappointingly, our greed for wealth has only increased. The
          unforeseen obstacle was in fact quite the opposite of what was
          predicted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of sharing in the bounty of the increased productivity, those
          with wealth chose to extract cheaper labor out of those less
          fortuanate than them. The mechanism of this was to deprive people of
          those same essential goods and services that counted as
          <em>absolute needs</em>, and then ration them out in ways that
          guarantee a source of income for a few.
        </p>
        <p>
          A good example of this mechanism is housing. There are many reasons
          for the real-estate markets are what they are some rooted in greed and
          prejudice. But the end result is that no matter how much middle class
          income grows (it doesn’t grow all that much) real-esstate will capture
          any surplus. The more one has the more one would be willing to pay for
          their basic needs. And the situation is not getting all that better

                  Large projects accumulate a large number of issue reports over
                  time. This is normal. Typically for a &quot;successful&quot;
                  project the rate of new issues being reported will exceed the
                  rate of issues being fixed. Hence the growth.

                  If you don't know what a refridgerator is nor what an elephant
                  is you are likely to think that opening the door, putting the
                  elephant in, and closing the door is a viable strategy for
                  putting an elephant in the refridgerator.
