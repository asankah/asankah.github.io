* SLICE introduction.
* What applies and what doesn't.
* Comparing workflows.
* The big S problem. There's no real security on the commandline.

Beyond SLICE
* Command output becomes passive and available for reuse.
* Super-ephemerality. Nothing to worry about from a dead program.

Other related issues:
* Window management.
* Keyboard centric.

Where this is going
* Not what you think.
* Wins on the commandline can transfer to the web.

How to bring keyboard centricity to the web.
* Each site comes up with its own vim-like binding.
* People need to be able to rebind.
* Please no caret browsing. This is the equivalent of really fast horses.
