The TL;DR of that video is:
Most of the gases in your farts are odorless. The one that usually makes things stinky is Hydrogen Sulfide.1 The content of H_2_S in a fart is around 50ppm.2 One fart can travel around 10 ft/s. Enter OSHA:
H_2_S at a concentration of 50ppm (roughly what you’d get if you inhaled a fart directly into your lungs) you’d suffer Slight conjunctivitis (“gas eye”) and respiratory tract irritation after 1 hour.</description></item></channel></rss>
