But I love Vim style modal editing and I’ve grown accustomed to some features that aren’t present or not well emulated in VSCodeVim.
Enter VSCode Neovim. I was intrigued by their claim to integrate Neovim instead of trying to emulate Vim.</description></item><item><title>Vim: Use Drop Not Edit, SBuffer Not Buffer</title><link>https://xn--izc.com/posts/use-drop-not-edit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2020 12:02:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://xn--izc.com/posts/use-drop-not-edit/</guid><description>I’m going to assume you are a Vim user.
Say you have a several windows open in Vim and you want to edit another file. Using :edit works if you want to open the file in the current window unconditionally.
But that’s often not what you want. If you have the same file open in another window, then the most efficient and least disruptive thing to do is to switch to that window.</description></item></channel></rss>
