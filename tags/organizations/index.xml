Hereafter, I’ll assume that you—dear reader—are somewhat familiar with the concept.
Measures like proof-of-work (PoW) are a necessity in intentionally slowing down otherwise free and uncontrolled operations. PoW’s most extensive critique is the resulting high resource consumption that lacks a corresponding commensurate positive contribution.</description></item><item><title>How to Solve a Problem in Three Steps</title><link>https://xn--izc.com/posts/how-to-solve-a-problem-in-three-steps/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2024 21:09:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://xn--izc.com/posts/how-to-solve-a-problem-in-three-steps/</guid><description>If you don’t know what a refridgerator is nor what an elephant is you

demographics or pretty much any context is bad. There is no reasonable

are &lt;em>“Asian”&lt;/em>.</description></item><item><title>Thirteen Years</title><link>https://xn--izc.com/posts/thirteen-years/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2023 16:30:52 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://xn--izc.com/posts/thirteen-years/</guid><description>Some reflections from thirteen years at Google.</description></item><item><title>Pillars And Governance Structures</title><link>https://xn--izc.com/posts/pillars-are-governance-structures/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2023 20:18:23 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://xn--izc.com/posts/pillars-are-governance-structures/</guid><description>Originally published on 2023 September 8.

Re-orgs.
It’s a fact of life for large organizations. A popular metaphor making the rounds now is this concept of pillars. The metaphor makes sense to some extent.
